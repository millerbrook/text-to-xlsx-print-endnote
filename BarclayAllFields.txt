“I was with Tho[mas] Lawson lately and I asked him w[ha]t he had done in order to ye Booke and ye instructions ye [thee] gavest him, and he s[ai]d yt he had done something and did intend to come up to ye, but as yet I have not heard whether he is come or not. I w[as] in Bishopricke [Bishoprick i.e. Durham] about ye begining of ye last winter and was at the Quarterly Meeting” which was attended by “many substantial men”; that county “is very well”; R[ichard] Watson “was their and [came?] in ye meeting, but I beckoned to him and desired him to stay forth of ye meeting till he as caled [to discuss his bankrupcy?] and so he did but w[ha]t he hath done I know not. I went to ye Bishop of Durham [probably Nathaniel Crew, later 3rd Baron Crew of Stene] with Jo[hn] Lan[gst]affe and Jo[hn] Bouldron [Bowron]. He was acquainted with ym, but me he sd he knew not, and I told him yt I was at London when we made aplication to him for our Freinds in this county and recei[ved] help and kindeses from him, and now I being in ye countrey, was willing to give ye acknowledgem[en]t of it to him. He sd I was very w[el]come and further sd yt, ‘I indeed received order from King Ch[arles II] to breake up your meetings and I sent to my neighbour Tonstall [possibly Edward Tonssale] and wished him not to meet so neare me, but he would not, but they kept… in their usuall place and so their goods was distreined, {but he said)’… He yt knowes ye secrets of all hearts knowes ye tribullation yt I [was?] in’… [and] yn [then] he sd yt he was bredd up in a religious familly and his mother [Jemima nee Walgrave] was a Puritan,… and no swearing nor curseing used amongst ym, ‘but now I am lookt upon as one yt would destroy religion’”; “I was willing to be gone, but he would not let us, but sent for a botle of wine, and we drinkt and ca[me] our way, but w[ha]t is become of him I know not [Crew was specially excepted from the general pardon of 1690, but was retained as Bishop of Durham]. Things is very well indeed in yt county. I was in ye Fels [Fells] and where about Paul Hobson [the Baptist plotter] lived and misted not any place in yt county yt I know of.

Abstract: An unfinished Poem which appears to relate to Catholic plotting during the early years of James I, the first of which mentioned here was the plot of [William] Watson, a Catholic priest [in 1603] “a crafty knave, hee first of all did dare to trouble the tranquillitie of our affairs, and then who know wth w[ha]t mad fury blind the Lancashire tall men, Wales afterward”; the leading conspirator is unnamed, being called in this poem, ‘Sinon’ [i.e. the name of the Greek who induced the Trojans to bring the wooden horse to Troy], but which may in fact be used here as a synonym for the son of the Devil; among those implicated are “one Pearcy… the King’s attendant and Pope’s slave [possibly a reference to Thomas Percy, who was involved in the Gundpowder Plot, but more likely a reference to Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland, who was imprisoned for misprision of treason after the Gunpowder Plot]”, and also the English fugitives at the Court of Austria, “desirous of new state,… their countrye’s ruine…[they] do wish with deadly hate”

Abstract: A fragment of an account of George Fox’s imprisonment in Carlisle [which began on 1 August 1653 and which lasted for seven weeks’ see Journal ed. John Nickalls, pp. 159-164]

Contents: “G.F. [George Fox] was kept prisoner to ye assises”, at which time Anthony Pearson, “then being at Carlile [Carlisle], perceived the Judges did not intend to bring him [G.F.]… upon his tryal,… wrote to ye Judges [of Assize for the Northern Circuit] in order that he might be brought to his tryal [for Pearson’s letter, see Journal ed. Nickalls, p. 161], but notwithstanding yt the Judges did not suffer him to be brought before ym [them]”, and in fact, “soon after… they were gon[e] out of town, an order was sent to ye jailer to put him into ye Dungeon among ye Moss-Troop[ers] [i.e. freebooters who infested the mosses of the Scottish border], thieves and murtherers”, which was done accordingly, “and the jaylor was very cruel and ye under—jaylor was very abuseive, both to him and Friends that came to see him, [and] one time… in a great rage he beat G.F. with a great cudgell, who the mean time was made to stay in the Lord’s power upon which… ye jaylor raged ye more”

Abstract: [This appears to be a brief reply to comments made by Fra[ncis] Bugg in his The Painted Harlot both Stript and Whipt: Wing B5380; especially on page 54 of that work; the author of this reply is unidentified] [see number 226]

Contents: Notes that on p[age] 54, Fra[ncis] Bugg discusses his "leveling law", wherein he says "he makes to level the ministers with ye hearers", and also on p[age] 56; have examined "it's equity" and have brought it "to tryal, wherupon arise these questions-
1. Whether ministers are not God's immediate embassadors, but must be chosen by ye hearers.
2. Whether those ministers of God give laws from Him to their hearers, or ye hearers give laws to them, what their embassage must be etc.
3. Whether they are to bear ye charge of their embassage, and besides ye sufferings within the labour and travel, peril etc., they are to bear the pecuniary mulcts imposed on them 100 fold for thier service to level them and make them equall with their hearers. 
1. As to ye first, if Francis Bug p[ro]fess himself an Independent, wee leave him to dispute his election with ye Bishop, with whom we leave him.
2. The 2d also may be disputed betwixt him and ye said Bishop who may try, if he can p[er]swade him to receive law from from him and not take it from him, F.B. to receive fro[m] ye B[isho]p, not give law to ye B[isho]p.
3. And as for ye 100 fold penalty, we leave this also to dispute ye equity of that with his B[isho]p, Justice and Lawyer, and whether they can allow it to be a levelling...that ye preacher is level or equal with ye hearer in ye offence..."; notes that the Independents "that chose their ministers as their servants do give them wages not exact [to] their penaltys...and gain by them. The instance he brings is no proof,...[but] onely shews something extraordinary and an exception, as F.F.'s action is, of requiring his penalty of ye preacher. Set his own baseness agt thothers [the others] nobleness [and] see whether iy will level ye balance of Independency. Indeed if ye preacher be 100 fold richer than F.B., such nobility is ye way by 100 sermons to level his estate to F.B.'s, but if ye contrary, what becomes of his levelling and ye reason of his levelling law, viz. That wee may all stand in a like suffering capacity. Must it not fall under ye other law which yet comes short of that, for none of ye hearers thereby are capable of half ye like suffering, except ye house owner. Where then stands his level of like suffering when he would have ye preacher suffer, it may be as much, it may be more than all his hearers, whereas ye other law allows that each hearer may bear an equal share in ye suffering, if he obey not F.B.'s law, which may make an 100 fold difference, whereas the other [The Second Conventicle Act, 22 Car.2, cap.1] at worst allows ye half. But will F.B. allow another levelling law, viz. that where ye hearer is richer than ye preacher, suppose F.B. ([rather] than S.C. [Samuel Cater]), ye hearer shall bear the penalty to bring them to an equality or upon refusal...to change estates? Well, or ill, however, F.B. has got into his pocket £15 of S.C. [Samuel Cater; for more on this episode, see Bugg's The Painted Harlot both Stript and Whipt, pp.73 ff.; also Samuel Cater's The Liberty of an Apostate Conscience Discovered; Wing c1486; see also number 221 above] for his penalty. Will he level estates with him or else return him it or change places with him for so long time that they may be in like suffering capacity? If ye B[isho]p minde ye reason of his law, as much as ye rest of his book, he cannot but expect it and if S.C. be F.B.'s servant, can the B[isho]p judge that the servant must bear a greater penalty than ye master, ye accessary than ye principall in a trespasse, for by his own principle F.B. must submitt to his penalty and make himself in like suffering capacity with him he makes his servant. And wee whose names are subscribed being sufferers in such kinde though not on such a principle as making them our servants, but looking on them as the servants of Christ, and for His sake preaching and making themselves our servants [and] for His sake do submitt to ye penalty (however imposed) without F.B.'s additional proviso,...whose law is this, in effect (see his Painted Harlot, p.54), that on sight of informers, ye preacher, unasked, must tell his name or make satisfaction, that all may suffer alike"; [two Scriptural references in the margin of side three- 1 Cor[inthians] 9:19 and 2 [Cor[inthians] 4:5]

Contents: [Very rough drafts all in the same hand; the following will deal with two of the drafts, as the third draft appears less important]; [top of side one-] "To F.B.'s [Francis Bugg's] l[ette]r, £7 reckon[e]d for p[ersecutio[n] of S.C. [Samuel Cater] and intrest. Habes confitentem reum, as to fact; as to ye right, he pleads ye Justice [Thomas Shelly] imposing ye fine gave it [to] him in lieu of charges. He quibles about ye witness as not lawfull, yet confesses it, who condemns him in point of justice"; he also says "after his discourse about his charges and ye Clark's exaction ye Justice was willing to give him £5, but doth not say in lieu of charges, but onely that he accepted it as for charges. The accepting of it as charges alters not ye nature of ye Justice's giving it as ye surplus of ye law, but his converting it to answer his own contracted charge. If he had sued ye Justice for ye overplus, would this have altered ye case?"; [the following is on side two]- "Haveing read...l[ette]rs of Joshua Bangs and Fr[ancis] B[ugg[ about £5 returned by ye Justice as certifyed by a Priest [Edmund Swanton, of Lakenheath] was told him by ye Justice now dead, and confest by F.B. [Francis Bugg] by him received, but in consideration of charges, intrest etc. I think no reasonable man can otherwise conclude but that seeing ye justice had levyed above what ye Act [The Conventicle Act, 22 Car. 2, cap.1] allows, £15 for £10,...he would leave himself (being a counsiller) within the danger of ye law, and return £5 in...lieu of charges which F.B. had brought upon himself, and ye Justice no way obliged to pay"; however F.B. "onely says, after complaint made to him [Justice Shelly] of his [F.B.'s] charges etc,  the Justice gave him £5, which he accepted...towards his charges of prepari[n]g...for 3 tryals of...3 appeals"; yet he does not say "the Justice gave it [to] him in that respect; otherwise he might have sued ye Justice for ye £5 levyed above ye Statute, and he [Justice Shelly] being dead, and ye other counseller not p[ro]duced that, as he [F.B.] says, told him ye Statute allowed £20 to be levyed on one man for another's offence, makes ye thing incredible, especially F.B.'s crafty dealing otherwise in this matter considered. His giving him £5 upon his compl[aint] of his charges in that respect onely, contrary to what ye Priest says the Justice told him, seemes but a shuffel and a concealmt of part of ye discourse and ye Justice's words, who was not likely so far to condemn his own act, as to pay him his charges for p[ro]secution agt it...So here was ye 'Trover and Conversion' [for the context of this reference, see The Painted Harlot etc., p.78] in himself he speaks of, turning ye £5 overplus into £5 for charges of his own choice, converting £5 principal into £5 interest and charges together. This is one of F. Bug's cunning tricks and contrivances. This is ike his converting £15 borrowed for half an hour for a tender on a table into £15 hurryed for evermore for a seizure into his pocket by lege[r]demain, converting his promise into a falsity and a nullity into a reality by his cunning chymistry and subtle sophistry, which is seen and more and more manifest[ed]. He despises J.B. [Joshua Bangs] as not so much as a student at law, because he says that not above £10 is to be laid on one p[er]son for another, but it may be queryed, has not he [F.B.] improved...himself as ye B[isho]p of Cheat in Italy who by his dissimulation converted that poor Bishopric into a rich Cardinalship thereby giving name to the practice?"

And are [Thomas] Crisp, and [Francis] Bug [Bugg] and J.W. [John Wilkinson], those he [William Rogers] boasts so of, that please people with such 'rattles' as he said J.S. [John Story] and J.W. did by their condemning something they had fallen into. Some of these 'rattles', his books, some of ye world's pepole do sell, but Friends send them back and they make Friends more setled"; feels that that Spirit must be chained; the envious man "hath slaine himself having not cleared himself from being an impostor and innovator, nor proved himself a true 'Christian Quaker' in all his 8 bookes or 'rattles', nor G.F. [George Fox] etc. guilty of Apostacy and innovation, nor told ye reader of what those bails and snares are, wherewith G.F. hath been betrayed, but they are general clamours, and his comparison of Saul's not hearkening to God's voice may be applyed to himself, not to G.F. for not hearkening to J.W.'s [John Wilkinson's] imaginations, answer[e]d by T.C.

And his parallel of Hazael suits himself, abusing those Friends he hath once esteemed, though he speak of love and bowells of compassion and pattern of patience etc. and Hazael's glass may shew him his biting, tearing, devouring Spirit"; although he makes "many iterations on W.P. [William Penn] (and so F.B.), it is nothing to Friends marriages in ye power of God [pp.25, 30, 42, 44, 70, 72, 73] but was spoke[n] to another condition,...and G.F. in his Epistle [printed Epistles no. 240] (which he cites so often) [pp.20, 25,26,30,50,64,75,76,77] saith, 'let your life be in that which never ends, nor changes, who are come to this will not go back to outward things' and speaks of meats, drinks, sacrifices, types, figures, shadows, baptism, supper etc. (and says the same still, for all their malice shewn, without matter), but G.F. speaks not a word agt ye order of ye power of God, of laying marriages before men and womens meetings, which was before that Epistle was writt,...but to shew it is no ceremony but moral (and so to put by ye scoffs and clamours of W.R.)

Is there any reason, but that women (without whom, there can be no marriages) with the Light of Christ, should see into ye marriages as wel[l] as men (as is in Friends exhortation he cites), else how should they set their hands to it? Must they pin their faith on mens sleebes and the men also on J.A.'s [John Aynsloe's] sleeve [see number 227], not bringing his woman with him, neither to them, nor the men? This would deceive them and parents of their childre[n]"; notes also "J[ohn] Harwood's order, and of a man in Kent, and one in ye North who came without ye women and ye women judged them and denyed them (20 years...since). Wee have no unity with such nor their order. Are they affraid of ye women that are wise orderers of familyes that they should discover something [a]miss if they should examine apart? And is it not moral, honest and civil and modest that women...should examine apart and be satisfyed before they subscribe? And so our...order is reasonable,...nor is it bondage but freedome to come to ye Light in all [p.36] as in Friend's Epistle. It was akwaies our practice, in ye substance, and G.F. wrote, before his marriage, to all men and womens meetings, as to one. And W.R., contrary to what he claims and exclaims for, complains and prints ag[ains]t Hadenham's [Haddenham; in the Isle of Ely] meeting before he hears it and ag[ains]t Barbados paper again and again when disclaim[e]d in matter and copy [pp.27, 28,29,30] and answer[e]d by R.R. [Richard Richardson],...and he charges selling ye copy of G.F.'s Primer [A Primer for the Schollers; Wing F1884], who says he never sold [a] copy in his life, knows nothing of it (but has manifested his minde agt selling any of his copyes), but E.H. [Ellis Hookes] printed it several years for himself. And complains W.R., for gospel order did he not cause his book to be read in Wilts[hire], and did not hee and J.S. [John Story] and J.W. [John Wilkinson] first content about ye shel [?] Nor does he prove his charges agt G.F. as yt about ye M[ary] Penington, [Nathaniel] Crips [Cripps], Ringwood [meeting, in Hampshire], Broad-mead [meeting, in Bristol], money at intrest etc., nor did when G.F. gave him a meeting at Bristol and he run out of ye meeting like a coward, which he calls G.F., though now he says he could not have one. And before that hee had shewed his papers agt G.F. up and down. Nor does he shew what is imposed"; he also makes a clamour "agt Micah's mother as an idolater to obscure her vertue and wisdom which G.F. commends in...encouraging and pronouncing a blessing on her son for restitution of that she had dedicated to ye Lord, but he medles not with her superstition in that dark time in that action. John Harwood, Rob[er]t Rich, Nathaniel Smith and John Parrot [Perrot] cryed agt forms and run out of ye order of Truth and what became of them? And then that company gathered out of Friends books what they had writ for keeping on ye hat afore men, so that they might thereby fortify their keeping it on in prayer to God, and now this company gather out of Friends books what they have writt...agt outward compulsion to inward...concerns, thereby to defend ye liberty of an evil conscience agt spiritual admonition, reproof or disowning and turning away from and having no union or fellowship with, in dark works. And besides them and T.C. [Thomas Crisp], J.A. [John Aynsloe], F.B. [Francis Bugg], J.P. [John Pennyman] and J.W. [John Wilkinson] who are reproachfull to Truth in paying tyth[e]s, marrying by a priest etc...that is their becoming all to all (is it not?) or take part with such, hee has not discovered who is his party...But that wee are become all to none is false, but in ye freedome of God's spirit condescend for their good to gain some, but not out of that. So let the wise in heart judge with that what is in it [and] what not"

Contents: Has seen his First Part of...Babil's Builder, "last printed in 1682, wherein thou has unmaskt thy selfe and taken of[f] ye vizard yt every reader may see ye face of Tho[mas] Crisp, ye informer agt ye people of God in scorn called Quakers, who hath ye vizage of Caine ye murderer"; whoever reads his book "may see aboundance of envie and wrath...and more malice then matter to defame, slander and abuse men in print, and he knows in his conscience yt R[ichard] Richardson and Steven Scrisp [Crisp] hath answered him to all these things fully wch he hath now printed over againe, both concerning ye Barbados paper [for more on this episode, see numbers 46-51] and wherein ye coppy was false R.R. [Richard Richardson] discovered wch was scatered up and down and their intent was wronged, and they haveing judged ye paper as it is themselves and ye answer being printed together with Solomon Eckles [Eccles'] condemnation concerning J.S. [John Story], and yet this malicious man T.C.....after Solomon is dead [Eccles died 2 January 1681/2] and hath condemned it [Eccles had predicted on 1 March 1677/8 that in that year John Story would die; he later condemned his action in this matter; for the prediction, see The First Part of Babel's Builders Unmasking Themselves, p. 15] is rakeing him out of ye grave and shouting at him and wickedly paraphrazeing upon yt false coppy yt he got from Barbados"; is he not "an impudent, shameless man, [for] doth not ye people of God now suffer in Barbados, their meeting doors being...shut up and there suffer ye spoiling of their good and imprisonment and in ye most goals in England and ye spoiling of their goods" and yet T.C. "saith, 'happy shall...those be who dash ym agt ye stones'"; see "his page 1 and 16"; also whereas T.C. by use of the term "'ye Foxonians', see page 3 and 8...is...here...ye informer...turned a nicknamer and scoffer of ye people called Quakers"; T.C. does not have the power to persecute them himself, "but doth it with his tongue" and sets the magistrates against them; also whereas "he brings Isacc Penington's name in print, he may stop his mouth,...for he hath abuised him all ready in print [Babel's Builders Unmasking Themselves; Wing C6948] wch is answered by his son [John Penington; see his postscript to Steven Crisp's A Babylonish Opposer of Truth]"; also notes T.C.'s attack on the Mens and Womens meeting and other "hellish and devillish lies and slanders wch he hath not proved in page 3"; also T.C. "saith, 'because they conscientiously reufsed to conforme to prescriptions without conviction' etc., page 3, what is it yt Friends hath put upon T.C.'s and his wife to conforme to without conviction, or any others? Was it his paying of tythes, or being marryed with a priest? Is this his 'implicit, blind and unacceptable obedience'? page 16"; T.C.'s charges are "but generall clamours without proofe"; also attacks his "lies and slanders concerning of Rome", [ages 7 and 13; in fact "they touch us not, but hath not Crisp's taken ye long stride towards Rome, who was marryed with a priest and pays tythes, for where did ye Xtians pay tythes and marry with...priests in ye Scriptures, or ye Jews ether?"; likewise, "if we were as T.C. hath maliciously and falsly presented, we should not suffer soe many in prison and spoiling of our goods at this time"; however, "let T.C., W.R. [William Rogers] and F.B. [Francis Bugg] write or printe what they will,...it will all return back againe upon their own heads"; also T.C. "makes a great noise about our orders and scoffeingly calls them 'G.F.'s [George Fox's] laws', but his envie hath soe blinded him yt he hath never brought a katalogue of them, what they are yt ye reader may see what they are, though he hath been called upon for them. And as for ye Pharise[e]s, it is like T.C's sentance agt us now, and Zedikiah smiteing Micah on ye cheek, thou art smiteing us with thy tongue"; T.C. is making void "ye New Covenant, a law writen in ye heart"; "These are T.C.'s lies and slanders where he brings G.F. and G.W. [George Whitehead] where it is said [in George Fox and others' letter to the Quarterly Meeting at Barbados; see The First Part of Babel's Builders, etc., pp.4-5] 'All must be left to ye universall Sp[iri]t in their own measures thereof',...and ye universall Sp[iri]t of God hath unity with ye least measure now as it was in ye Apostle's dayes, who kept every one to their own measures, wch was both ye great rule and line of ye New Creature in ye beleevers and Saints then, yea, and now, and all are to give up to ye universall Spirit in their own perticulers in wch Sp[iri]t they have unity and fellowship without outward prescriptions and to be lead by ye same Spirit to see their names writen in heaven in this gospell day of Light and life, and their heavenly subscription, wch is above all outward subscriptions, both among ye Jews and professors, for one tyes them below and ye other tyes ym above, and these words of G.F.'s and G.W. overthrows all ye clamours, lies and false accusations about outward orders and outward prescriptions yt T.C. mak[e]s such a clamour about in his book, but doth not give a katalogue of them"; likewise, T.S. says in page 11 "'not submitting to G.F.'s orders without conviction', and this T.C. goes over and over in his book, but he hath not said what those orders are", and he also says in page 9, 'now those yt are termed stuborn etc., are not against men and womens meetings, but differ about ye forme and power therof'",  opposing, among other things, separate womens meetings "'where thy live remote from each other and have noe buisyness',...but T.C. should have...gone into ye country...to ye womens meetings there and have seen if they have not busyness and service for ye Lord and His people, or must they aske T.C.'s leave?"; why does he concern himself "About our womens meetings, who are in ye practice of ye pure religion to visit ye widdows and ye fatherless,...and if Xt be in ye female as well as ye male, why should he not be a wittness concerning ye marridge in ye one an in ye other, soe yt they may goe through ye men and womens meetings yt all things may be kept cleane, and many things are more proper for their own sects to loook into and to speak unto among themselves, and who ever desired T.C. and his wife to come to ye men and womens meetings and submitte to any thing there without conviction and in pge 8 thou saith, "are you soe foolish as to beleeve yt requireing of men and womens meetings without Scripture evidence', and...in page 9...saith you are not against men and womens meetings in cittyes and towns, ...soe here is a plaine contradiction", nor are the Scriptures silent as is claimed, for the Apostle "said yt ye elder women should be teachers of good things... of ye younger"; queries whether he loves his neighbours, especially R.R. [Richard Richardson' or G.F. [George Fox]; attacks several points made on page 10, and also T.C.'s calling womens meetings "'G.F.'s womens meetings', page 11", which scoffs and scorn "doe not hurt G.F. nor ye honourable womens meetings, wch are ye Lords"; he would be wise to "find a day of repentance for his wicked work wch he hath publisht agt us", a work which "is of ye Devill and not of God", and yet T.C. "would make people beleive he is a friend to ye people of God called Quakers", when in fact he is a Judas betraying them "as his ooks doe manifest"; read Romans 3:13, 16,17,18 "and apply it to thy poisonous tongue"; notes what the Apostle said to the Corinthians and what the Apostle wrote to the Hebrews; also T.C. "hath not disproved with all his ravelling...and abusive words ye Church of Xt in Burbados [Barbados] to be other wayes yn G.F. and G.W. hath writen to. And T.C. tells us of ye virtues as in ye 2d of Peter, through which...their is an enterance into ye everlasting kingdome, but in his writeing he manifests himselfe void of all, and not like one yt hath seen ye everlasting kingdome, but like one yt is [s]training at gnats and swallowing Camels"; attacks his abuse of Steven Crisp and R.R. [the name "W.[illiam] Gibson" has been crossed out and "R.R" placed above] who have cleared themselves in print; notes that G.F. and G.W.'s words are "'Dear Friends, we know your care and tenderness of Truth and yt you aime at ye best things', and therefore this is a base abuse or a perverssion of their words"; (there is a postscript in a different hand- "Why hath not T.C., W.R. or F.B. print[ed] J[ohn] Wilkinson['s] false prophecy ag[ain]st Friends, wch he never yet condemned, as S[oloman] Eccles did his?")

Contents: "concerning which visit I could say much, but it may suffice to remark that it appear'd to me to be a time of gathering and great openness among people of various ranks, who followed us from meeting to meeting, treating us with respect and the marks of real love and affection, but knowing we had nothing valuable of ourselves. I attribute all to divine goodness, who opened the way fpr us and is alone worthy. Margaret [unidentified] sometimes appeared in public testimony and I thought to good purpose, and was to me a good companion"

Abstract: [A lengthy Manuscript pamphlet directed against W[illia]m Rogers. It does not appear to have been printed, nor do the minutes of the Second Day’s Morning Meeting shed any light on the author; this pamphlet is in rough form, and is directed against Rogers’ The Seventh Part of the Christian Quaker; Wint R1862] [see number 233]

Contents:  Notes that W[illiam] Rogers “often boasts with his party concerned with him and tells of ye contraverss [contrivers?] of ye parties…in England, and speaks of part of people called Quakers who would make his cause seem big in ye readers eyes,…and many is come off from J.S. [John Story] and J.W. [John Wilkinson] and hath given certificates and testimony agt ym [them], and how they were deceived by ym, and how many testimonies have been given forth agt W[illia]m R[ogers] and why did he not print ym, and ye churches in ye most of all ye counties in England and Wales gave a testimony of their clearness f[ro]m yt foul sp[iri]t of J.S. and J. W. and W.R.”; their writings and printed books have shown them to be apostates and innovators and not true Christian Quakers; disputes his [W.R.] comments relating to the tree of knowledge; see Jo[hn] 17:3; also disputes his comments on circumcision and mentions W.R.’s “8 parts [of the Christian-Quaker] or 8 books or 8 rattles to please his children,…and we call ym his ‘rattles to pleas his children’ because he calls J.S. and J. W.’s pretended condemnation wch they gave forth in y north, ‘a rattle to please children’, after they had separated and made a separation,…and did not W[illia]m R[ogers] draw up…that rattle 9for J.S. and J. W.) to draw children f[ro]m ye Light?”; they cannot deceive true Christian Quakers ‘thought he or his company send his rattles or wicket books to New England, Burbados [Barbados] and many…part[s] of ye nation,…and hath not some beyond ye sea written to W.R. and sent his rattles back againe and written agt ym?”; feels that W.R. “hath not cleared himself f[ro]m being an apostate and innovator…in all his 8 books,…ne[i]ther hath he manifest[ed] G.F. [George Fox] and ‘his party’, as he scoffingly calls ym guilty of apostacy and innovation,…and whereas W.R. falsely compares G.F. to Saul who did not hearken to ye World of ye Lord through the mouth of Samwell [Samuel]… [it] is applied to himself better, and for G.F.’s not hearkening to J.W., his false prophecies and immaginations is answered in C.T.’s [Christopher Tyalor’s] book [Something in Answer to Two Late Malitious Libels; Wing T265]”; queries whether his [W.R.’s] books “doe declare yt he hath taken up a lementation and whether ye sufferings and exercises wch he speaks of are become W.R.’s…Can Bristo [Bristol] say soe of W.R.?”; notes the various pages on which he [W.R.] attacks outward forms of government; “see how he and F.B. [Francis Bugg] mudles their head about orders and hath not given a katalogue of ym”; notes that despite what W.R. says, ‘we never heard yt ye Presbiterions [Presbyterians] or churchmen laught and scorned at our Women’s Meetings, but rather justified ym by their books”; notes that W.R. “brings W[illia]m Pen’s [Penn’s] Liberty of Conscience [The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience once more Briefly Debated; Wing P1299; see page 11 of this pamphlet], p. 25 and againe W. Pen in p. 30” and again “p[ages] 42 and 44, his Adress to Protesans [An Address to Protestants; Wing P1247] over and over”; both W.R. and F.B. “goes over and over Wm Pen’s words wch is nothing to opposse Friends order concerning maridges”; notes the number of instances where W.R. “saith, see G.F.’s generall Epistle printed formerly by M.W. [probably Mary Westwood; see Russell Mortimer, “The First Century of Quaker Printers,” JFHS, 40 (1948), 44-45; the Epistle in question was printed in 1664 and can be found in Fox’s printed Epistles, pp. 220-224, Epistle no. 240]”; yet “it will not cover him nor serve theire turns, but ye reader may see your folly and G.F. saying in his epistle…as followeth, ‘now they yt doe…set up outward things gather…people to ymselves and not unto God’, but w[ha]t is all this to ye purpose? G.F. saith ye same still, for their was Men and Women’s Meetings before this Epistle was given forth,… and G.F. speaks of many outward things in yt Epistle, forbidding of meats, drinks and sacrafices, types, figures and shadows and days and times and circumcision and how theire was jangling about Baptism…and ye Supper and about men, some for Paul and some for Apollo”; there was “not one word in G.F.’s Epistle yt speaks against ye order of ye power of God of laying of maridges before Men and Women’s Meetings”; notes W.R. in p[age] 24 relating to ‘ye women in ye I[s]le of Ely… (with relation to ye permitting of maridge)” that they “may be counted of ye Quorum for yt without their permission a maridge cannot pass. Thesse are light, scoffing words…and why should not ye women with ye Light of Xt see into maridges as well as y men?”; notes the many times that W.R. mentions the marriage of Jo[h]n Ansley [Aynsloe] simply because “Friends had not unity with J.A. laying his maridge before ye Men’s Meeting because…he not bringing ye woman with him yt they might hear w[ha]t she could say…and though F.B. [Francis Bugg] saith it is nothing less yn excomunication to ye uttmost  of our power,…W.R. and ym yt are concerned with him may blush for shame yt tolerate such a maridge, for such a maridge as J.A., who declares ye intention of his maridge and ye meeting must owne it without hearing wt ye woman saith…would let ye louse Sp[iri]t at liberty and might deceive many an honest man of his child,…and this is W.R. and F.B.’s new outward forme or method”; notes that J.S. [John Story] and J.W. [John Wilkinson] “were agt ye laying of maridges before ye Men and Women’s Meeting twice, yea and why not more if ye meeting and their relations be not satisfied and their consciences be not answered, for why should they impose their maridges upon ye meetings, who will not goe to ye Men and Women’s meeting twice, wch is a thing below ye world, who asks ym in ye Steeplehouse 3 times”; nor are the Men and Women’s Meetings distinct as has been charged, for they are present together in Spirit; more on the rights of women in this matter; again notes the case of J.A. who desired to marry his house-keeper but refused to bring her before the Men’s Meeting, let alone the Women’s Meeting; feels that “if J.A. had not been ashamed of his house keeper, he might a brought her before ye Men’s Meeting wch is not agt yt wch is modest, civill and of a good report”; they can not have unity “with such a practice, for a man to tell of a maridge before ye meeting and not bring ye woman,…for there was such a thing done in Kent,…and allso Jo[h]n Harrod [Harwood] stood up at Ye Peel in a meeting at London and said he did intend to take Mary Pease [‘ary ease’ is crossed out] to his wife, and another did ye same in a meeting in ye north,…and all ye women judged ym for doeing such a thing in theire absence and Friends judged ym alsoe and had noe unity with ym…and this was about…20 year[s] agoe, soe it is noe new thing for ye Church of Xt to judge such things”; it was “never our principle or practice nor the antient labourers to owne such a maridge as J.A.’s or Jo[hn] Harwodes [Harwood’s],… but G.F. and ye antient laboure[r]s have testified agt such pretended…maridges,…both in ye north and south about 20 years agoe”; as concerning marriage, “G.F.’s Epistle and W.P’s [William Penn’s] Adress [see above] signifie no such practice [as J.A.’s] nor R.H. [Richard Hubberthorne] nor Josiah Cole [Coale] nor F.H. [Francis Howgill]”; both parties should especially appear in questions of marriages involving a brother with his sister or vice versa; only if both appear can Friends judge whether such a marriage be in the Light and of God; also as concerning marriage, G.F. “sent an Epistle to be read in all ye Men and Women’s Meetings in ye world of his intentions of marridge and said yt all ye meetings to him was but as one”; notes that W.R. in page 5 “saith, ‘moreover a Friend advises yt he can prove yt ye maniscript of ye Primer [A Primer for the Schollers; Wing F1884] scribed by G.F. and E.H. [Ellis Hookes]  was sold for 30 pound…and G.F. reflects upon ye priests for makeing a trade of ye Scriptures and if these things are not a token of apostacy and innovation’”; in fact, G.F. “hath affirmed yt he never did give consent to [nor knowes of) any such thing, nor ever had a farthing… on any such account…but hath clearly manifested his minde aft ye selling of any of his coppyes,… and let W.R. bring out yt Friend, ye informer and tell his name…and who it was yt sold ye maniscript, for it is known yt Elis Hooks printed ye Prim[m]er for himself severall years, yn [then] ye maniscript was not like to be sold”; as for the Quarterly Meeting at Hadingham [Haddenham] “in ye Ile of Ely” which is mentioned by W.R. over and over again and which is based on a letter from F.B. [Francis Bugg], “hath he not…pined his faith upon F.B.’s sleeve and given his judgement and printed F.B.’s information before he went to ye Quarterly Meeting in ye Ile of Ely”; W.R. “saith, ‘now I shall proceed to cite a paper f[ro]m Barbados as one part of ye pretended established government’…and he goes on concerning yt paper…in his 27 and 28 and 29 page and 30, peraphraseing upon it, though ye Friends at Barbados had given an answere to yt paper and showed wherein it was defective, both in matter and copy, wch hath been printed, and W.R.’s party had printed it once before, to witt T.C. [Thomas Crisp, in Babel’s uilders; Wing C6948], and R.R. [Richard Richardson] answered it [see his A Few Notes etc., in Stephen Crisp’s A Babylonish Opposer of Truth; Wing C6924]”; blames J.S., J.W. and W.R. and their followers for being the first to make contention in relation to “outward forms and methods relating to marridge and reliefe of ye  poor”; yet “they are easy to be deserned and known where ever they are by their fierce unruly sp[iri]ts and tongues, and was it be W.R.’s order yt this, his wicked booke in ye Meeting house at Chipnum [Chippenham] in Wilkshire [Wilthsire] should be read?; would also like to know “w[ha]t was ye names of ym yt railed upon J.S. in a generall way? Why didst thou not publish..their names?”; W.R. “in all his 8 books or parts hath not proved his false charge, not yt concerning Mary Penington nor yt concerning [Nathaniel] Crips [Cripps] and his sons consar[n]ing Tieth [Tythe], nether yt concerning ye meeting at Ringwood and yt meeting about London where he saith soldiers came…nor ye meeting at Bristo [Bristol], Broad-mead [meeting]…wch he saith his owne eyes see nor where G.F. hath £1,200 or £1,300…at intrist [interest] and ym yt knows it to be well secured. All these things and a great katalogue more (denyed by G.F.) may be drawne up, wch he hath printed (and not proved) and are spread up and downe both in England and beyond sea”; notes that J[oh]n Blakland [this has been corrected in another hand to Blakling, but the modern form is Blaykling], J[oh]n Ware’ [appears to have been corrected from Wars; ‘Ware’ is correct] “and 27 more, their certificates and testimonies stand over W.R.’s head”; likens him [W.R.] to Caine [Cain] and Friends to Abell [Abel]; queries whetner G.F. did not have “a meeting with thee at Bristo”, and that Friends there “knows how of the [W.R.] went out of ye meeting in a fury and rage and G.F. called him to sit downe to make his owne papers good, line by line with him by 2 or 3 witnesses and how…Tho[mas] Kent [did] fe[t]ch him in againe”; he has acted “like a treacherous caurd [coward]…agt G.F. to goe up and downe ye nation and shew his dirty papers agt G.F., as London and Harford [Hertford] and other places behind his back w[he]n G.F. was about 200…miles off…and now he hath printed ym to ye view of ye world, and he or his company hath sent ym behond [beyond] sea,…and hath he not done ye same to J.B. [probably John Blaykling] and R.B. [probably Robert Barrow] and R[obert] Barclet [Barclay] and C.M. [probably Charles Marshall] and many others?”; again demands greater specifics from W.R. and F.B. in relation to various charges made by them; W.R.’s books are “a bundell of contradictions, confusion and malice as may be seen and is proved in Ye Accuser [George Whitehead, The Accuser of our Brethren Cast Down; Wing W1887]”; notes W.R.’s charge against G.F. in relation to Micah’s mother “spoken of in Judges 17” and replys to it; see Judges 17 or 18; W.R.’s “false charges, calumies and false accusations: have not answered his critics nor proven his “false charge, noe more yn Pope Leo’s [the Tenth’s] Bull yt he speaks of, nor Pope Paul ye 3d”; although W.R. “goes over and over G.F. and his party, as he scoffingly calls ym,…he hath not tould us who are ‘his party’ and if it be T.C. [Thomas Crisp] who was married with a priest and payd tythes and J. Ansle [‘nsle’ is crossed out] and F.B. and J. P. [John Pennyman] and J.W. [John Wilkinson]”; notes that “in ye days past, ye apostates did write agt Friends and G.F. and picked all ye sayings of Friends out of their books and epistles, of not…putting of[f] our hats to magistrates for wch they fined and imprisoned us, and thus ye apostates perverted to keep on their hats in prayer and now ye apostates perverted to keep on their hats in prayer and now ye apostates bring ye sayings of Friends in their books wch they have written to ye persecuteing magistrates and others concerning liberty of conscience and soe to oppose our order in ye sp[iri]t and power of God concerning marridges in our Men and Women’s Meetings..Jo[hn] Harrod [this is been corrected to ‘Harwood’], he cryed agt our ‘formes, orders and prescriptions’ who came to a meeting and said yt he did intend to take Mary Pease [‘ary ease’ has been crossed out] to…wife and she not theire with him at ye meeting, and he was judged by her and antient labouring Friends and w[ha]t became of him, and Robert Righ [‘Righ’ has been corrected to ‘Rich’], he cryed agt our ‘froms and orders’ and wt became of him? and Jo[hn] Parrot [Perrot] cryed out agt our ‘formes and orders’ and wt became of him? And Nathaniell Smith, he cryed out agt our ‘formes and orders’ and wt became of him? And did not all these print, or some for ym, agt us and did not they all runn out of y’form and order’ of y Truth as may be seen in their books?”; asks W.R. if “ye people of Bristo think yt Jo[hn] Ware’s certificate is not of as much credit with ym as Nathanie[l] Day’s is with W.R.? And F.B. saith to W[illiam] Pen[n] that some suspect he lookes one way and runs another by his disputing on G.F. his part when he, some think, was ashamed to appe[ar] himself, p. 67, but what some’ (agst both W.P. and G.F.) those are…F.B. ha[s] not brought out theire names in print”; What W.R. sows he will reap “wch will be a great crope of corruption and wickedness”; neither W.R. nor J.W. have proved themselves true Christian Quakers [this line originally spoke of W.R. but has been altered to include J.W.]

[On side one is a warning to a judge “of life and death” i.e. the judge sitting on the Crown Bench at assises]- warns him to “take heed of putting any man or women to death for cattell or money, for by ye law of God they were to be sould for there thefte if they had nit therewth to make restitution, soe see yt all ye lawes be according to yt in ye conscience, for ye law of God is according to yt in ev[er]ye ones conscience”; God will hew down all those “who acte contrary to yt in ye conscience”; [on side two is a warning to “ye Judge of life and death and to ye jurie of life and death so called”]- warns them not to “cast ye pure law of God beehinde your ba[c]kes…and sett not up a law in your owne inventinge wills wch is not p[er]fect, but is contratye to ye p[er]fect law of God wch accordinge to yt in the conscience”; [this is signed, “from prisoner of ye Lorde in outward bonds for wittnessinge ye Truth wch I have received from God, ye Father of Lights”]

Contents:

Love to her “and all the hous[e]hold of faith wth thee”; warns her to “beware of earthlie mindednesse [for] the Tempter is subtill [and] Hee that searcheth and tryeth my heart will tell thee soe”; “Thy callinge is to waite uppon the Lord and when Hee calls the[e] forth, to declare His name”; she must not “consult… wth flesh and blood”; asks that she “bee faithfull in thy place where the Lord hath thee”; she is “a haindmaiden of the Lord to serve Him and to beare the testimo-nie of His name… [and now must thou goe forth as a valiant souldier to fight the Lord’s battle, to thresh uppon the mountaines and to minister freely, as though hast received freely, to declare what the Lord hath done for thy soule”; she must not neglect His work, “least the cursse fall uppon thee”; many Friends there salute her and “the word of the Lord doth growe abundantly in divers places, and my deare brother Richard Farneworth [Farnworth] wth the dearely beeloved brethren and sisters in the Lord att Balby salute thee and… George Fox and James Nayler. My love wth my deare brother Roger Hepton [Hebden] and William Dewsburie [Dewsbury] salutes you all”; the corruption of the magistracy “is greate wth us in divers places in the West Rideinge [Riding] of the countye [Yorkshire] especiallie, but in the East Rideinge, there is justice acted and the evill doeers are rebuked”; the Lord ‘doth manifest His power aboundantly in those parts and in divers places, but the rage of the Sodomites is gre[a]t and some they turne out of their houses and others they sewe [sue] at the Lawe, and some they beate, sotne and imprison most violently strike wth staves and swords, and wth their fists most shamefully. There was a greate meeteinge att a place uppon Ackworth More [Moor] Topp [Top]. The preist did appoint to goe wth his hearers to meete my brother Richard Farneworth. Some wch formerly had been his hearers, beine moved to goe to the steeplehouse and cleamed [i.e. stuck] up two papers, one of [on] the steeplehouse dore and another note far of[f], con-cerneinge the preists errors. Many people were made to reede them and [were] convinced it was Truth and proved by Scripture and confessed to our Frends it was Truth. They see a greate deceite in their preist and some of his hearers wth some of our Frends did reason wth the preist and did demand of him to goe wth them to meete their Frends uppon the More [Moor] Topp [Top] and make forth that wch hee had accused their Frends wth all, and shewe forth where in they erred from the testimonie and make good what hee had spoken by accusinge such a people wth such reports, soe that if they was in an error they might bee proved and tryed”; “The fox did make them beeleeve and did promisse to meete them such a day as was opporinted, but when the day came, hee fled out of the towne and proved himselfe a lyer openly to the people and to bee of the Devill, his father, but many of his hearers did goe up wth our Frends to the place. There was nighe 200… persons, but most of their mouths was stopped and many of them convinced of the Truth,… all but one sc[h]oole master, soe called, wch did contend in his will, but his mouth was stopped and hee fledd away, lookeinge to have drawne some from the heareinge of the Truth, but fewe did followe him, but continued. There was one of them of the preists hearers wrought uppon and a great temblinge came uppon her and my brother Richard Farneworth was carried forth much to shewe unto the people by testimonie of Scripture the like example amongst the Saints and Holy men of God”; not a hand was lifted up “against our Frends at that place, thoughe many came wth swords, staves and pistles”; however, on the way to a Friend’s house, after going from the meeting “they mett wth some wilde beasts w[ho] fell uppon them violently”, having gotten drunk at an alehouse; there was “one man, a servant unto one Ireland wch dwells nere unto Wakefeild [Wakefield], both hee and his master are papists [an] the[y] fell upoon my brother Richard Farneworth and Tho[mas] Goodeyre [Goodaire], a Frend wch I doe beeleeve hath beene wth thee. The papist servant man, did breake his rod unto his hand uppon them and was rageinge madd, and then drewe forth his sword and stroke violently at Tho[mas] Goodeyre and cutt him in two places; in his heare hee was cutt. Hee stroke till the sword did fly out of the hilt”; although innocent blood was shed, the Lord “did keepe our Frends to receive all in patience,… but Tho[mas] Goodeyre[‘s] brother in the flesh was made free to goe to one John Ward of Pontefrett [Pontefract], who is one of the greate kinge Pharaohs amongst us. Hee is called a Justice. Hee sent mee to the gaole and Besse [Elizabeth] Hooton and is a greate p[er]sectuer of the Truth. Hee is son-in-lawe to Tho[mas] Vincent wch was one of the flase witnes wch swore against mee”; “The Lord did move mee out of love and tendernes to wrtie to one of my false accusers wch did take oath against mee, but hee redd [read] a litle of it and… fell into a rage. Hee was drunkerd drunke in all iniquitie and kept and Alehouse. Hee threwe it into the fier and afterward, hee was troubled that hee did not reede it and the Lord strucke him shortly after wth sudden death. This Tho[mas] Vincent, my other false accuser, I was moved to goe to his house to declare against his oppressinge of the pore to make himselfe rich in divers wayes. His estate was greate in the outward, 6 or £700 a yeare. I was made to speake in pla[i]nnes of speeche to them,… but they fell into rage. His wife sayd I was madd and wisht mee not to medle wth her religion and shee would not medle wth mine, and I told her she might be brought to judgement, and she sayd, ‘God, thou art madd’. Shee was strooke shortly after into madness and destracktion in her sence and soe died. Yet this old Pharaoh Vincent is not warned, but his heart is heardned [hardened] to p[er]secute the Innocent”; as for John Ward, of Pontefrett [Pontefract], he was “demanded to doe justice and to give out order to bring in these rude creatures wch did cut Tho[mas] Goodeyre and strike others, but hee sayd except they would sweare and take oatht hey was afraide of God,… hee had nothinge to doe wth them, and the Frend not seeinge freedome, beinge commanded not to swear at all” could simply bear testimony of the truth “that hee and others received such stroakes, and some wounded by such men, but hee would not grant noe warrant out to the Frend wch demanded it”l therefore the Law “is of noe effect ebinge put in the hands of injust men… to execute it”; fortunately the Lord “did heale the wounds imediately”; is moved “to putt thee and others in remembrance that you bee not forgettfull at your meeteinges to make contribution of those outward monies wch the Lord hath made you steward of to doe good unto all, but especiallie to those of the Hous[e]hold of faith… I did receive the love of my father made forth in their free contribution to the necessetie of my deare brethren and sisters, fellow prisoners”; there are “many pretious hearts wth us not in out[ward] bonds, wch some are cast out of their houses and others in greate p[er]secution for the Truth[’s] sake, and many pore in the outward doe receive the Turth and made faithfull in the sufferings, but fewe of the rulers can beeleeve because the Truth preaches destruction to their Kingedome wch lives in formes and shaddowes,… and therefore are they blinded wth the God of the world and now comes the Children of Light to bee tried and proved by the fruites they bringe forth”; there is a “widdowe, one Judee [Judith] Key [Kay] wch abideth in Yorke [York] who is kept verye faithfull wth her hous[e]hold [of] 3 daughters wch are wth her. Shee is in greate want of outward necessaries, beinge left indebted. The world falls uppon her and she is much in wants. There is others divers, but to her necessetie, if the Lord doe move thee to make knowne to any Frends, such who are estblisht in the Truth to make a contribution for her in what the Lord doth move thee. There is noe necessetie for the prisoners wch I knowe. If there bee any contribution, send it to mee or her and I shall give it to her. There is one thinge wch I have beene moved much in that there might bee meanes amonghst you used to send forth 2 or 3 who are made free to followe such a callinge as to keepe the markets in your contry wth bookes”; would be a great way “to confound those greate Babilonish places”; there are “many pretious bookes printed”l have 4 of them “lately comed from London set forth by… Richard Farnworth, and divers others of… George Fox and James Nayler”; just as the Lord “hath appointed mee to… gett these printed, soe it is required of you… to carrye this the testimonie of the Turth abroad”

[This is confusing as there appears to be four different parts to this document, not all of them connected] Part one- A warning to him who has hardened his heart, to “come downe into the dust, and fear the Lord,… [and] mourn before Him in sackcloth and ashes for thy sins are now made manifest”; “Wo[e] to you rich men, for the cry of the poor of this nation is heard in the eares of the Lord. Now see and consider with thyeselfe that thou be not one of the oppressors of the poor”; he must “repent and be ashamed for the evil of thy doings” or the Lord shall destroy him; Part two- Warns that the day is coming “that shall burne as an oven” and all those who are proud or act wickedly shall be burnt and therefore, “wo,wo,wo to the inhabitants of the earth whose dwelling is in the earth”; “Repent and turne to the Lord from all iniquity that though maist be hid in the day of His fierre [fiery] wrath”; “See if though be not yet in Babilonish confussion. Is it not confussion to say though art the filthyest creature living, and presently to say Christ dwells in thee? Is it not conufsion to say Christ is not a binding example for any to walke after, but only His p[re]cepts?”;  “He that is Christ’s is a new creature, all old things are done away and all things are become new, but he that is a filthy creature is a stranger to Christ who comes to make all things new and to destory the worke of the Devil. Hee that saith Christ Christ is not a binding example to any stranger to Christ and playnly declares himselfe to bee a heathen”; those who abide in Him “walke as Hee walked”l see 1 Joh[n] 2:6; if he will “bow to Christ and honour Him… then thou wil[l] not be ashamed of thy servants, as thou sayst thou art, who is made to bow downe to the Lord alone and to give all honour and praise to Him and not to bow downe to thee any more as they have form[er]ly done”; signed by T.A. “whom the world cal[l]s as Q[uaker]”; Part three- “Your faith now is but a meer fancy, a… thing received by tradition, one man from another, but where is the teachings of God amongst yee”; only differ from the heathen “in outward profession”; nonetheless, “you read or hear read often that Scripture that saith ne[i]ther circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth anything in the kingdom of God but a new creature… [and] all things to him are become new- a new Lord and God and so a new life and new law, new baptisme, new living spirituall all things”; however, “what is become new amongst you, unles how in a new way or fashion of life you may please your flesh and satisfie yourselves in the lusts thereof”; must not “think any longer that your dawbings with your untempered morter of formall praying, preaching, hearing, reading or other kind of outward professing will any longer serve your turne”; God must be seen to be “a spirit, a consuming fiery spirit, burning up all your owne inventions and lusts”; “Destory that man of sin in every one of you that stands up agaynst any of the Holy and just breathing of His holy spirit in you”; Part four- “Thou waste moved, I p[er]ceive to send my wife [Mary nee Killam] a token. I gather from the report thou might hear of her outward necessity. The Lord supplies us graciously, so that we have noe cause to complayn, for it is His mercy that we are not consumed”; wishes that the Lord “would teach thee and all thy fellows really to mynd justice, mercy and humble walking with God, more then the world, sin and vanity”; as for “my particular, thou canst do no greater act of charity to me or myne then to hearkning to the Truth to learn to fear God… [for] God is more pretious then fold to His Israel”

Is moved to write to him, having heard that he is one “wch doth owne the Truth”; asks that he be “valiant for the Truth uppon earth and treade uppon the deceite”; “O what hath beene p[ro]missed to the libertie of the subject on takeinge of[f] oppressions, the oppression in tythes and oppression in your corrupt lawes and divers abominable oppressions wch still remaine, and rew the preist and those wch receive them, haveinge many of them, left the Scripture to defend them. They betake them to the magistrates to defend them by their lawe, and brand the Truth wth ‘Sect, Error and Sichsme [Schism]’…because it comes to speake against the deceite in them. They are greedie doggs,…teachinge for filthie lucre and hire, wch the Word forbids,…and the[y] leane uppon the Lord and sayth, ‘The Lord is wth us, there shall noe evill befall us’. Deare Frend, dost not thou see these thinges?

Now is the power of the Land given into the hands of the magistrates to try them, how they will prove themselves and quitt themselves of that wch they have condemned others for…O, quitt your selves like men and bee valiant for the Truth,…[and] beware of seekeinge honor of man”; the cry of the poor and oppressed “is entered into the eares of the Lord,…and cryes for vengeance to fall uppon the man of sinn. Here is nothinge but oppression and selfe ends, pride and vanitie and lascivioussnes in that nature, oppression in rackeinge of rents [i.e. rack-renting-a very high, excessive or extortionate rent], oppression in tythes, oppression amonghst the gentrye, preist and judges, justices, lawyers, all receiveinge gifts and rewards contrary to the teacheinges of the Lord, for the judges and justices are not to take gifts”; “Minde what manner of men Moses sett over the people to bee judges and officers. They was to judge the people wth just judgement and not to respect persons in judgement. See what sort of men Jehosaph[at] [Jehoshaphat] sett up to judge the people and the charge hee have them, and hee said to the judge and the judges, ‘Take heede what you doe, for you judge not for man but for God, who is wth you in judgement”; “O how is this lawe and truth corrupted, this respectnge of persons, men beinge partiall set upp to judge, takeinge of gifts and rewards, and yet p[ro[fesse to live in tru[th]”; the entore nation “lyeth groaneinge under the oppression of the clergie and their hipocrisie is daylie more and more made manifest”; the priests “were ever ye greatet persecuters to the Truth, as they are now” but the Lord has “sent His servants and maides to cry out against their deceite and hypocrisie and some of us they cast [in]to prison, some of us they shamefully entreate wth mockeinges, scoffinges and revileinges”, but the Lord has come to “make a seperation betwixt the sheepe [and th]e goates”; “The Ministers of Jesus Christ was never p[er]secuters, but was p[er]secuted, but the preists take upp armes wth the Dragon against Michael, our Prince, but Hee will overcome the throwe downe all powers that stands in oppresion against him, and the Saints shall possesse the earth”; again warns him to “bee faithfull in the Lords’s worke and beware of lookeinge out after selfe ends and earthlie vanities, and seekeinge after earthlie honors…least thou bee cast out”

Doe justice and see peace bee kept. The Lord requires it at thy hand’. Another time, ye same Topinge did give command to keepe mee out of ye cittie at ye barre and sayd I deserved to bee had on wth two men on to the gallowes and hanged or tyed downe to a stacke and burned, and another time, hee came to mee in the Minster and sayd I did neither feare God nor man and sayd they might goe up to London to gett a law from ye Lord Protector [Oliver Cromwell] to take a course wth mee, and now I have tried their spirits…and by their words and actions they are manifest, and now there is but one thinge wantinge, wch is to gett a law and yt by this our law, this man must dye, wch they want to satisfie their blood thirstie mindes.

Abstract: 247a. T.C. [Thomas Crisp; the initials have been written in ink, but the pamphlet is probably his]: Innocency Vindicated: In Answer to a Pamphlet Entituled, “A Few Words to Nath[aniel] Coleman’s Epistle,” etc. [by John Field; not in Wing], wherin MANY Lyes, Forgeries, Blasphemy, Ranting Doctrine, and Atheist-like Practices of the Authors, Approvers, and Licencers of those FEW WORDS etc. are Manifest…[no date, place of publication or printer].
Printed. pp. 16. 21 cm [not in Wing]
Contents: Notes that the “Wicked Ones time is short”, for he rages “through his ministers, G.F’s [George Fox’s] preachers and party, G.W. [George Whitehead] etc., his brethren, of… The Second-Days [Morning] Meeting, who have manifested themselves false Apostles…by their…forgeries and untruths, that they have lately licensed and published, subscribed by G.W, J.F. [John Field] and other such mercinaries…who seem to be given up to that lying spirit, which was suffered to be in the mouths of Ahab’s Prophets”; notes in particular “that piece of perverse envy of theirs, entituled, A Few Words to N.C’s [Nathaniel Coleman’s] Epistle (to thom this is intended)”; attack on the Womens Meetings; feels that N.C. was attacked because his epistle was “printed without your license, and so a denial of your supremacy”; because “your enmity is so great against N.C. and because you have not just cause to find fault,… you unjustly quarrel with the Direction of his Epistle (to be read in the Assembly of God’s people)…[which] you call, ‘his prescription’. If so, your master G.F., G.W. and most of you, who usually directed their Epistle to the ‘Children of the Light’, or ‘People of the Light’, etc. are such, for do you not give them out to be read? Nay, your persecuting wicked Bull against J.S. [John Story], was not that given ro be read in the Assemblies of God’s People? … For shame, do not thus unmask yourselves, Babels-Builders, judge another, and do the same thing?”; [continues on much in this vein for the next six pages, with references to “Peter and some Martyrs”, Pharaoh, Esau, Adam, “the Parable of Dives and Lazarus, Luk[e] 16:26”, Abraham, the Pharisees, Cain, Belial, Israel, Ephraim, Samaria, Hosea, Moses, “priests”, the Apostle [Paul], Romans 1, “the Jews”, “the Gentiles”]; notes that is is not for want of eternal life “that the people perish now, but in your esteem the people perish for want of obeying your laws of Womans-Meetings, apart from Men, and they to have power to examine men twice before they marry, or else not to ‘suffer’ or ‘permit’ (say you) ‘marriages’, and for not conforming to such your new invented laws, you have the impudence to defame and unchristian people, for should the ‘knowledge of the Lord in their own particulars’ be increased, then you, G.W. etc (shrine-makers) your craft by which you have gotten much gain, will be in danger”; calls their doctrine “Babylonish and Ranting, for you have confessed it”; notes that N.C. “warns Friends from THAT which would draw the mind from God”, which was meant to imply “that there is such a principle or spirit which he terms THAT, even that of yours, which leads you…to bely him and pervert his words, and falsely accuse your brethren and would compell them to fall down and worship your great Idol, and you do, by your practice teach that unless people will be circumcised with G.F.’s circumcision and keep his and your laws, they cannot be saved. This is the THAT which N.C. warns from, which you call the ‘Spirit of God and Truth’, and which drew out their minds to that ‘erronious Barbadoes [Barbados] judgment’ [for more on the Barbados episode, see numbers 44-51] (your principle) also that led G.F. to send that wicked, deceitful letter, mentioned in 1st, 4th and 5th Babel’s [Crisp’s First, Fourth and Fifth parts of Babel’s- Builders Unmasking themselves], and THAT which would ‘not suffer nor permit marriages’ without the consent of two of G.F.’s ‘Womens-Meetings’…also that which contribed and brought forth that abhorred Bull of 66 against J.S. [John Story] etc.”; attacks the impudency of a statement made by G.W. [George Whitehead] “in his book entituled, The Quakers Plainness [Wing; W1949], pag[es] 70, 71,” in which he makes a “Jesuitical reserve of distinction between books and writing”; also N.C. wsas warning against “THAT which too much rules in your Men’s and Women’s Meetings of G.F.’s party, giving power to such as G.W. to send out of their mouths floods of lyes and pervertions against J.S., N.C., W.R. [William Rogers] etc”; [pages 11-14 are upside down and in reverse order]; feels that the “spirit of charity in N.C. torments your spirit of pride and envy in that it allows God’s people may be of various or differing minds and judgment as to outward observations of days etc., which is contrary to you…but N.C. would not have the spirit or power of appointing any form, time or place lockt up only in G.F. and you of the Second-Day’s Meeting, to govern not only all Europe, but America also”, for all times and seasons are in God’s hand, and as N.C. has said, “It is the general consent of all sound Protestants that no traditions nor cannons of any visible church…but the Scriptures ONLY, interpreted by the spirit in us…gives the final determination of matters of religion, and that only in the conscience of every Christian to himself.’ This was and is sound ‘Protestancy’, but perhaps may not be for your advancement,…but rather on the contrary, believe as the church believes, that is more likely to advance G.W. to G.F.’s place of Chief, or Arch-Bishop of all your party and then why may not your Father allow the Order of St George, as well as of St Francis etc.? You cannot assume a more seeming harmless title than your brethren the Jesuits have, viz. “The order of Jesus’”; [continues in the same vein for several pages]; feels they are “perverters, forgers, lyars, blasphemers and ranters, false accusers, raylers and like wicked atheists doing that you condemn others for, as is evident by your forging so many sentences,… and for your calling for plain Scripture to prove, and urging F.B. [Francis Bugg] for your president. There is much difference in the case, for F.B. desires Scripture to prove such things as you impose as God’s Laws and Ordinances on people to believe and practice,…but did you do as you would be done by, then you should first have given F.B. plain Scripture (according to his desire) to prove those things, but instead thereof see your answer in R.S.’s [Robert Sandiland’s] book, falsly termed Righteous Judgment [Placed; Wing S661], p. 22”; notes their treatment of him [T.C.] particularly their reciting on page 17, “J.F.’s [John Field’s] words to me [in Field’s J.F.’s Reply unto Thomas Crisp’s Rapsody, p.13; Wing F864c]… to which I replyed in 6th Babels [The Sixth Part of Babel’s Builders Unmask’t; not in Wing], pag[e] 11”; mention made of R.R. [Richard Richardson], and also of “the Barbadoes subscribers”; as for G.F., “I find it in print that he termed himself ‘The Son of God’, and ‘an establisher of righteousness’. Also in a relation of some passages between him and O.C. [Oliver Cromwell], it is wrote that he said. “He whom the World calls G.F. is…THE Son of God’”; in all six Babels, “I have proved them guilty of many untruths and wickednesses”; accuses C.T. [Christopher Taylor] of slandering J.S. [John Story]; mention of his [T.C.] 4th Babels [The Fourth Part of Babel’s Builders Unmask’t]; also mention of the “3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th Babels”; “God grant you repentance”

Beseeches him “to judg[e] favourably of me.

Many wise men have sout [sought] to have this [land from the Indians], and could not prevaile, for the[y] had not the Indions [Indians], jenaral [general] and free consent”; as for the Indian Kings, “the[y] wil[l] sel[l] my Frinds any land the[y] have. I have given… the Kings and Prinses a coat in ernest for the land and sum[e] other dets [debts] the[y] owe me which the[y] say shal[l] be payed if I have not the land.

One of them said an Indion King speaketh but on[ce] about land, that is to say, the[y] doe not chang[e] or falsify their word conserning land”; it had been noted “that whereever… Inglishmen [Englishmen] hath brought land of[f] Indions and have payed them honestly for it, those plantations hath reseived no harme by Indions, neither in [word indistinct] tim[e]s, nor other times. Now I think [it] needful to send copyes of the deeds for land and a convaance and a copy of Lord [Thomas] Culpeper’s grant, and a description of the land that thou and Frinds may know how it is as wel[l] as I can describe it. If Frinds desir[e] to do anything with the King [probably Charles II or James II] about… a peculier titel then Lord Culpeper knoweth that the Indions did acknoledg[e] to him and the Counsel [Council] when he was Governer [of Virginia; Culpeper was first commissioned in 1675, but it was served by deputy until 1680; he was himself removed from office in 1683 for having left the colony without royal permission] as a genara [general] coart that the[y] was wiling to sel[l] me that land for Frinds. I reserved a titel in the convaance to myselfe becaues I might do furder [further] in it if need require, If the convaance be not wel[l] made, the[y] may writ it beter and I wil[l] set my hadn to surender it, hou [how] thou and the[y] shal[l] thinck good, for I desire but a lot as other Frinds may have the licke. I intreat thee be pleased to let me heare from the[e] as soone as conveniant and whether though and Frinds are wiling to be conserned with this land and what you would have me to doe conserning …this land, or any other thing. I am wiling to do as much as I am able. I am a pore widow and a trew Frind”;
(Postscript- “Corrinal [Colonel] Josepth [Joseph] Bridger said he would have me to write to my Frinds that he would sel[l] them twelve thousand ackers of land which he said I knew to be good, and I do know it to be very good land. I spack to tel[l] Frinds how that is”)

: R. Foveler visages [voyages], 1657 [this is by George Fox] 
Contents: 
It had often been manifested before him to make use of the vessel and he had New England presented before him; when the vessel was ready he was, contrary to his mind, brought to London "where speakeing toughing this matter to Gerrard Roberts and others ...[ they] confirmed ya matter in behalfe of ya Lord that it must bee soe, yet entering into reasoning and letting in temptations and hardshipps and ye losse of my life, wife and children wth [with] the enjoyment of all earthly things, it brought mee as low as ye grave and laid mee as one dead as to the things of God, but by His instrument G.F. [George Fox] was I refreshed and raised up againe...[and] I was made willing to doe His will; yea, the customs and fashions of ye custom house could not stopp mee. Still was I assaulted wth the enemy who pressed from mee my servants, soe yt for this long voyage, wee were but two men and three boyes besides my selfe, Upon ye first day of ys 4th moneth [June, 1657] recieved I the Lord's servants [Eleven Freinds boarded the vessel- William Brand, Christopher Holder, John Copeland, Sarah Gibbons, Mary Weatherhead, Dorothy Waugh, Robert Hodgson, Humphrey Norton, Richard Doudney, William Robinson and Mary Clark] aboard"; they set sail and came into the Downes [Downs] on the second day "where our dearly beloved W.D. [William Dewsbury] wth Mich[ael] Thomson [Thompson] came aboard...and after recomending us to ye grave of God, wee launched forth"; had thoughts of complaining to the Admiral "for ye want of my servants and a convoye", but did not; soon after, the South wind blew hard, causing them to put in at Portsmouth "where I was furnished wth choice of man according to one of the Captaines words to mee that I might have enough for money, but hee said my vessell was soe small, hee would not goe ye voyage for her"; remained there for some days "wherin ye ministers of Christ were not idle, but went forth and gathered stickes and kindled a fire and left it burning; alsoe severall Freinds came aboars and visited us"; finally left there 'about ye 11th day" but were soon " put backe againe into South Yarmouth where wee [went] ashoare and in some measures did the like: alsoe wee meet [met] wth three pritty large shipps wch were for...Newfoundland, whoe did accompany us about 50 leagues, but might have done 300 if they had not feared the Men of Warr, but for escapeing them, they tooke to ya northwards and left us wthout hope of helpe to ye outward, wch before our parting, it was shewed to H.N. [Humphrey Norton] early in ye morning that they were nigh unto us that sought our lives, and called unto mee and told mee, but said hee, 'thus saith ye Lord, you shalbee carried away as in a mist', and presently wee espied a great shipp makeing up towards us and the three greate shipps were much afraid and tacked about wth what speed they could for it. In ye veary interim, ye Lord God fullfilled His promise and strucke our enemies in ye face wth a contrary wynd...Then upon our parting from these three shipps, wee were brought to aske councell at ye Lord and the word was from Him, 'cut through and steer your straitest course and mind nothing but mee'"; they met together every day and the Lord manifested Himself to them "soe yt by storme, wee were not prevented above three tymes in all our voyage; the sea was my fi[gure] for if anything got up w[i]thin, the sea w[i]thout rose up ag[ains]t mee and then ye flouds clapt there hands, of wch [in] tyme I tooke notice and told H.N. Againe in a vission in ye night I saw some ankors [snchors] swimming abo[ve] ye water and something alsoe of a shipp wch crost our way, wch in our meeting I saw fullfilled, for I myself wth others, had lost ours [anchor], soe yt for a little season the vessell run loose in a manner wch afterwards by the wisdom of God was recovered into a better condition then before. Alsoe upon ye 25th day of the same moneth [June], in the morning, wee saw another great shipp makeing up towards us wch did appear afarr of[f] to have been a friggott and made her signe for us to come to them wch unto mee was a great crosse, wee being to[o] wyndward of them, and it was said [by the Lord], 'Goe speake [to] him. The crosse is sure. Did I ever faile thee therein?', and unto others there appeared noe danger in it, soe that wee did and it proved a tradsman of London by whom we writ backe [to London]"; when they had been at sea 5 weeks, having sailed about 30[0] leagues, H.N. [Humphrey Norton] "falling into com[m]union wth God, told mee yt hee had recieved a comfortable answere and alsoe yt about such a day, wee should land in Amirica [America]. wch was even soe fullfilled. Alsoe thus it was all yee voyage wth the faithfull wch was carried farr above stormes and tempests, there lives joyned all as one and did direct her way, soe yt wee have seen... ye Lord lead our vessell...reguardin neither Latitude nor Longitude, but keept to our lyne, wch was and is pur leader, guide and rule, but they yt did [follow latitude and Longitude] failed. Upon ye last day [31st] of the fift[h] moneth [July] wee made land. It was part of ye Long Island, farr contrary to ye expecation of the pylate [pilot]. Furthermore our drawing had been all ye voyage to keep to ye siuthwards, untill ye evening before wee made land and the ye word was, 'There is a lyon in ye way', unto wch lyon wee gave obedience and said, let them steer northwards untill ye day following and soon after ye middle of ye day, there was drawings to meet togeither before our usuall tyme and it was said that wee may looke abroad in ye evening. And as wee sate wateing upon ye Lord, they discovered ye land...Wee made towards it and espying a creeke, our advice was to enter there, but ye will of man resisted, but in yt estate wee had learned to bee content and told him [the pilot?] both sides was safe, but goeing yt way would bee more trouble to him. Alsoe hee saw after hee had layed by all ye night the thing fullfilled...This creeke led is in betweene ye Dutch plantation and Long Island, where ye moveing of same Freinds were unto wch otherwise had been veary difficult for them to ye place appointed and us into our way, according to ye word wch came to C.H. [Christopher Holder], 'You are in ye road to Road [Rhode] Island.' In yt creeke came a Shallop [i.e. a large heavy boat fitted with one or more masts] to meete us takeing ud to bee strankers [strangers] makeing our way wth our boate, and they spoke Engligh unto us and informed us and alsoe guided us along. The power of ye Lord fell mcuh upon us and an unresistable word came unto us that ye Seed in Amirica shalbee as ye sand of the sea. It was published in ye eares of the Brethern wch caused teares to breake forth wth fullness of joy, soe yt presently for these places they prepared them selves wch were Robert Hoggen [Hodgson], Rich[ard] Dowdney [Doudney], Sarah Gibbins [Gibbons], Mary Witherhead [Weatherhead] and Dorothy Waugh wch the next day were put safely ashoare into ye Dutch plantation called New Amsterdam. Wee came and it being ye first day of the weake, severallcame aboard on us and wee begun our worke. I was caused to goe to the Governor and Robert Hoggen wth mee. Hee was moderate, both in words and actions. Robert and I had severall dayes before seen in a vission the vessell in great danger. The day following this was fullfilled, there being a passage betwixt two lands, wch is called by ye name of Hellgate. Wee leight veary conveniently of a pylate and into yt place wee came and into it were forced and over it was carried, wch I never heard of any before that was...Rockes, many on both sides, soe yt I believe one yeards length would have endangered losse of both vessell and goods. Alsoe there were a scull [school] of fishes whcih persued our vessell and followed her dtrongly and along close by our rudder, and in our meeting it was shewed mee, 'These fishes is to thee a figure'...Surely in our meeting did the thing run through me as oyle and did mee much rejoyce"

“The Lord hath been pleased to exercise me at this time as I lay in my bed…in the morning very early…[and] this word sprung in me mightily, ‘Hear O King and live for ever etc.’”; this occurred again the following morning, and therefore, “it was upon me to rise and put my pen to paper and write those words…and then I had ease, and it was to the King [Charles II], but it was not with me how he might have it and I was in a great strait, and I cried mightily that He would take it off me because I was of a low capacity to perform so great a work”; therefore, “it was with me to acquaint Laurence Steel with it and Richard Sneade [Snead] that they might convey them to thee, and a coppy of it helped forward by thee,…but I am better satisfied since my Friends undertook to send it to thee”; encloses the words she had written, which in essence warn the King to take off “this great oppression that is put upon the tender consciences of His tender people, that thou mayest live for ever”

His heart “runefe out to the[e] in that eternall union which is hid from all the world”; was refreshed “by cominge over to Swarthmore to se[e] the[e] and thy litle ones so caried on in the power of Treuth”; on parting from George [Fox], “as I cam[e] to Pustan [Ulverston] I began to be sad and when I cam[e] at prest [William] Lampat’s [Lampitt’s] house I hovered but found no motion at all to goe in. At the end of the towne, I was rideing to goe the lower way amongst the houses, but on a sudan [sudden], I was moved to take the higher way. When I had riden a litle I se[e] playnle [plainly] I was brought that way to meete Will[iam] Lampet [Lampitt] and so we met at the litle gate that goes to the steplehouse wheare we had a greate deale of discourse”; at first “I tould him he was a persecutor of Ch[rist]. He denied and sayd he witnesed Ch[rist] in him. I asked him how he cam[e] and what way he cam[e] to have Ch[rist] in him [and] he sayd, ‘Through death’. [I] asked, ‘Hast thou pased through death’? He answered, ‘yea twenty yeare sinc[e]’. I sayd, ‘But whear art thou now? Death roules the[e]. Thy act[i]ons demonstrate playnely’, and I tould him playnly he was in captivity to his lusts and what he knew was naturall. Then he upbrayded me with my leter and I tould him it was Trueth and what I wrote I was the same. Then I tould him he was an enemy to the Crose of Ch[rist] and then he playnly descover[e]d himself and sayd, ‘I live under no Crose at all’, to which I sayd I knew he did not. He sayd he was come to the Crowne and this 4 years he was under no Crose. I sayd to him, ‘is all subdued, thy will and all sin in the[e]’? He sayd by Ch[rist] he was compleat. I tould him it was without and thearin he was deseved, and tould him playnly it was the serpent that spake those things. I was very fre[e] to have spoken longer to him, but he would have bene gone. He sayd, ‘I hop[e] you will alow me the same liberty you have’, that was that none should speak agaynst his deseaite [deceit]. I tould him playnly thear was no liberty to that nature he lived in [and] I would him he was to be chayned up and all his philactaries [phylacteries] puled of[f] and his crowne he tould of must be taken from his head and all throwne to ut[t]er darkness. Much more discourse we had [but] I doe not now rem[em]ber…I tould him he could owne Georg[e] Fox in words in all things, but not the power. He sayd George held many swe[e]t things, but he caled me ‘devell beast’ and ‘antechrist’ and he sayd, ‘I canot owne that’. I tould him if he had bene a minister of Ch[rist], he would have abide[d] in His Doctrine, but I tould him he did not. But I am weary of repeating thease things”; love to her and her family from he and his wife [Dorothy Howgill]; “All freinds heare ar[e] well”

This letter is very interesting and needed more context.  

William Lampett is mentioned almost exclusivley in this letter, Howgill in the letter to Margarett Fell tells of him going from Swarthmore to the Home of Lampett and not finding him but running into him near the steeplehouse the “high way” home specifically to tell him he is a “persecutor of Christ” and have a discussion about his ways/ lusts (cant wait to find those out).  

Doing some digging I found the website above that tells of Lampett and his relation to the Friends. 
He was the parish Priest of the Fell’s before Judge Thomas Fell’s death (Margaret Fell’s first husband) 
George Fox and Howgill believed him a man full of filth (this letter gives continuity into that belief) 
Thomas fell was not a Friend but he loved George Fox and felt God through himself at his hands. 
Later when Fell passes Margaret will marry George Fox and hold the Freinds beliefs and Swarthmore becomes the epicenter of the Religious Society of Friends.

Abstract: 244. Leonard Key: A Reply to Part of a Book signed William Lambol [Lamboll], John By [Buy], called, 'Something in Answer to Thomas Curtice [Curtis], and B.C.'s [Benjamin Coale's] Reasons [why the Meeting House Doors were Shut up at Reading'; not listed in Wing], or a Looking Glass for them and all that had a hand in it, that they may see what they have been doing; With an Answer to the Postscript; Also an Answer to James Potter's Paper, that is at the end of there Book. Reading, about the Middle of the Seventh Month [September], 1686. Printed. pp.8. 28cm. [Not in Wing], [The answers to the Postscript and to James Potter's paper are by Benjamin Cole [Coale] and are dated, "The 17th of the Second Month [April], 1686"] 
Contents: Admits that "there is a defference amongst the People called Quakers in Reading,...and you with many others that have been contentious for the from have been the cause"; no surprise "that you have appeared in print again, tho one of you have been looked upon to be a very steady man, the other to be wavering, but some time since he said in the hearing of many, if the Freinds at London did err, he would err, since that he hath been chosen to go up to the Yearly Meeting"; wonders "what will be the end of this your work that are now idolizing a House, time will speak as well as it did by those that use[d] to cry up the Womens Meetings, that peice of formallity that hath been also the cause of much strife,...and if you did speak plain, I do think it hath been the ground of your keeping on  your hats"; queries "when and where did T.C. [Thomas Curtis] and others appear in such rude behavour in meetings as you have done?"; notes their comments about books and papers set forth by such as W.R. [William Rogers] and S[usanna] Saldredg [Alridge]; in relation to the latter, "if you had but advised with Oliver Sansom, it might be he might have tould you she was crazed in her brain", and thus they would not have needed to quote her "nor what she hath writ"; mention made of T.G. of London in relation to staying behind after a meeting; as for "what W.R. [William Rogers] and S.A. [Susanna Alridge]...hath writ, had not there been a cause, the books and papers you mention would not a been writ,...and if any desiresto o see for themselves and not take things upon trust,ey may see what W.R. hath said in his book in 5 parts [The Christian-Quaker; Wing R1858], and also the two papers of S.A., one called Abomantions [Abominations in Jerusalem Discovered [not in Wing], the other, One Warning More to all Formal Preachers [not in Wing]"; notes the behaviour of J.B. [John Buy] "at a meeting...about ten mills [miles] from Reading"; also notes, "what a bussel you or your company made at a meeting on the first day at Reading, I think in the year 1684, where was A.S. [unidentified], one of another nation, and many more that was strangers besides S.B. [unidentified] and O.S. [Oliver Sansom?] (that insendiary)"; comments on the ownership of the meeting house, and the separate meeting kept there, "which was kept at the meeting house in the afternoon on the first dayes, was first mentioned...at the Monthly Meeting, and reasons why it was desired, as may be seen in the Book [the Monthly Meeting Book; as a result of the separation, there were two Monthly Meeting Books kept] where things of that kind use to entred, as appears by the date which was the 12 mon. [February], 1681[2], and some of you did take a week's time to consider of it, but J.B....said he has considred of it allready and if all did come to meet at the meeting house, he would not, and the reader may take notice that in the 6th month [August] of the same year, G.F. [George Fox] did come to Reading, and take up his lodging at a Inn, and at that time made a great ado about W.R.
s book,...and at that time he did endeavour to set up the Womens Meeting"; also heard that G.F. "went up to the Meeting that was kept in London street", a meeting not approved of, "for it was set up without the knowledg[e] of many Friends, and he said to them, as I was told, if that was a Seperate Meeting, where there was one, he did wish there was ten. This might much confirm W.L [William Lamboll], as also his being chosen to go up to London at the Yearly Meeting, so that from that time, instead of making up the breach, things have grown wider, ... and now such may consider... the message delivered at their Second Day's [Morning] Meeting in London in...1674....by John Hogg" warning against forms, and also "what was of the Lord that came unto him the 20 day of the 6 month [August], 1675 [the '7' has been written in ink over an '8'] to repent and turn from their proceedings"; notes that "you say 'the propositions he mentions in his [Thomas Curtis] paper are arbetrary and penal', to this I say I do not well understand the extent of those words, and so do refer the reader to the paper it self,... but then you say, 'We will here for brevity give one particular instance and leave it to the impartial reader's judgment. In the first month [March], 1686 [the final '6' is written in ink over a '9'] J.O. [John Osgood?] a Friend of London came to this town and desired and had a meeting with T.C. and some others, where it was signified that the Friends of London have heard that they had shut up the meeting house doores...and had desired him to inquire the reasons', and the reasons, say you, they gave being 'mostly such as B.C. hath now published'"; this is not the full truth, for "there was two papers of yours read and two answers of our Friends to them,...and what was then read was not like what B.C. hath now published"; as for the postscript "that is thrust into your book", without a name, "[I] shall take no more notice of it, I having had to do with a nameless author formerly, which you by your former Book [A Stop to the False Characterizer's Hue and Cry; Wing B6349A] did endeavour to cover. You may see 2 Sam[uel] 14 what Joab did"; also see "Ezek[iel] 13: part of the 10,11,12 verses"; [the next section is entitled "Here is something in Answer to the Post-script"]- Despite their [Lamboll and Buy] use of Job's words in relation to their grief in having to appear in public against their former friends, their actions "for many years do not agree with these expressions", for they have been "the chief instruments to stir up and carry on contention in this place both publickly in meetings and printing"; reminds them of "a true remonstrance...writ[ten] and signed by many Friends at a Quarterly Meeting in the second month [April], 1680, directed to many brethren and sent to London, about the time of the Yearly Meeting the same year, but alas, no answer had we, nor notice taken of our crys and groanings...till those differences broke out like a flame"; nor should they [Lamboll and Buy] note 1 Cor[inthians] 6:5, "for we have good ground to believe that they would not have scrupled going to law with us, if thereby they thought they could have obtained their ends. We neither go to law with them nor fear referring out cause to such as we judge impartial, but not to such as have appeared against us"; [the next section is entitled, "Here followes the Answer that was sent in writing to J[ames] P[otter] to the Paper that is made publick"]- has his paper "without date, wherein thou mentionest those few reasons given for shutting up the Meeting House doors [The Thomas Curtis faction shut the anti-Curtis faction out of the meeting house on the pretext that Curtis had built the house], which thou saist thou lookest on as no good or sufficient reasons at all,...but James, if thou dost not esteem them sufficient reasons, yet that doth not follow they are none at all"; [continues at some length to justify the Curtis position including the statement that "it [the House] was not settled or given by T.C. for the use of such (tho called Quakers) that were not so in practice or principle as the Quakers then were when that was built and don[e]. It's true T.C. caused a writing to be made in case he should dye and put Friends upon making the house over to four Friends or Trustees to secure it, but...he is still living and hath all along appeared to be the chief proprietor"; also, "I hope  thou art not ignorant that they have for severall years had a meeting in London street, a (publick standard of seperation), but that is not reason for us to take away their right...but it seems it is not for want of a place that they meet without doors...[and] they have in my apprehention forfited their right, if they had any as a part of that society (see W.P's [William Penn's] [An] Ad[d]ress to Protestants[Wing P1247])"; brief comments on T[emperance] Tailer [Taylor] and John Parot [Perrot], noting that the latter was the one who "brought in the sitting ith the hat on when Friends prayed"; as for Friends in London, "we need not concern ourselves about them.  We have enough at hom[e]"; agrees that "it was not T.C.'s act wholly, but if it were I believe he would have no cause to repent of it", and in any case, "I doubt not but he can clear himself without our help...[and] therefore the best way is to speak with him thy self and likewise those that by the Monthly Meetings desire and T.C.'s took that trust upon them"; because of their [Coale and Potter] ancient acquaintanceship, "I was loath to controvert with thee and therefore have said the less...[but] as to thy request that they might have the use of the meeting rome [room]...and we could meet together as in the beginning in love and charity, I see no likelyhood of it, [for] we are well satisfied in what is don[e], as knowing our end was good therein"]

Dated:

[Difficult to say with precision, but Besse, I, 699 indicates that Rigge was imprisoned for not going to church in July 1676 where he remained for half a year. It is possible that this may have been written then, for Rigge would not have written to the Magistrates of Surrey from 1662-1672 when he was imprisoned in Horsham, in Sussex. Also Rigge mentions the leinency of the magistrates towards the papists, which of course, was not the case after 1678 with the Popish Plot. Rigge also menions the King’s Declaration, which might have beent he Declaration of Indulgence of 1672, which was revoked early in 1675]

Has been commanded by God to write to them in order to warn them “not to stretch forth your hands against His people” nor to harm “His prophetts… [and] servants, for they are His heritage and Hee is tender of them”; asks them to “take a view of all such proceedings from the begining of ye world to this day and you shall finde that it was a righteous thing wth God to render tribulation upon them whoe troubled His poor, dispised people, both in ye time of Ye Law, in ye dayes of ye Prophets, in ye gospell dispensation and in the time of ye heathen emperours, alsoe thorow ye reignes of severall Kings and Queens whoe gott the name and tytle of Christians, yett retaining ye nature and spirit of the heathen persecutors that went before them”; they were all rebuked by the Lord “for His poor seeds sake, though they, while in power and dominion thought themselves high, wise and learned, and to have done Him service in imprisoning, whiping, killing and banishing His servents, whoe allwayes apeared poor, meane, foolish and illitterate in ye eye of ye wise Doctors and learned Rabbies, and in all ages were accounted as sheep for ye slaughter”; the Lord is now “leading His poor, dispised, little flock in scorne termed Quakers at this day”; they [the magistrates] have “noe more to charg[e] us wthall of any rebellion or dissobedience unto you, but they conserning ye law and worship of our God, then Darius, ye King had against Daniell nor Nebuchadnezzar had against the 3 children or ye Jews of old had against ye followers of ye Lamb of God, nor Queen Mary [Tudor] had against ye poor, dispised martyrs in her day, nor your learned Bishops, Doctors and priests,… noe more able to stand before us this day, whom they call weak, ignorant and unlearned, then the Bishops, Docters and Priests could stand before them in that day”; has read that “those idollaterous Bishops and Priests in Queen Mary’s dayes did seek to convince them whoe stood as witnesses for God against them then by argum[en]ts wch they had, though weak, before they delivered them to ye secular powers to suffer, wch had some collour of reason in it, but the Bishops and Priests now delivers us up to the secular power to suffer before they have either seen or spok[e] on[e] word to us”; “How dare you sitt judges over mens faith and consciences and persecute men for not conforming to that wch neither your Bishops nor yourselves knowes infalliably to be Truth, and how can you asertaine us (if wee should conform now to your uncertaine way of worship) that both yourselves (if faithfull to your own principles) and us may not suffer in a short time for not conforming to another worship wch may be sett up direcctly contrary to yours now”; are accountable to mortal men only if “wee or any other transgress the good and wholsom [wholesome] laws of England in temporall matters between man and man in civill rights, properties or privilidges”; if that occurs, then “spare us not, but lay your sword upon all transgressors”; asks that they “invite your Bishops and Priests into a fair field with us to use our spirituall weapons and lett them not for shame condemn us before they hear us”; would like to know “what evill word or deed hath been proved against mee since I came into ye county of Surrey, either in faith, principle or practice? Whose Ox or Ass have I wrongfully taken or whom have I injured?... Why am I hailed about from Sessions to Sessions and neither freed nor anything proved against mee? Is there either law or reason for these things? Is it not my birth right as an En[g]lishman herein denyed mee?”; would also like to know “why am I comanded to be kept close prisoner, when you had soe many testimonyes of my faithfull apearing whenever I was called at your courts?” asks them to consider “how few of ye papists against whom many laws have been made, is now hailed before your judgm[en]t seates or cast into your prisons. I am not against the letting of them and all others alone in matters of faith and worship to God soe logn as they live peacably amongst men, but why then is ye lawes made against them in perticular executed upon others more innocent?”; “Doth not… your proceedings vindicate ye papists in all their cruall persecutions of ye Martyrs in their dayes”; warns them not to “medle… wth judging of spirituall matters relating to another world, for God hath comitted that judgm[en]t to His Son alone, and it is His prerogative Royall wch Hee will not give to any mortall man”; before they proceed further “in these matters” they should use their “utmost endeavors to gett your ministers into some publique places in the county where wee called Quakers or some of us may meet wth them, and if they havea nything to charg[e] us wthall, that wee are not able to vindicate by plaine Scripture, their own proffessed rule, then you may have some more ground to proceed against us, but yett wee read that the members of the true church when any opposed them or wthdrew from them, they first exhorted them privat[e]ly and if they did not hear,… then had they gained their brother, but if they would not, then they had them before ye church and if they refused to hear the church, they did not deliver them to ye secular power to be imprisoned or burnt, as the papist did, and as the Bishops and Priests doe now, but onely were to account them but as heathen men and publicans. Here was noe precept nor example to fine or imprison them or spoyle their goods for not obeying the true church, and if your Bishops and Priests refuse this way and manner of proceedings and cry out to you to cause us to suffer before wee are heard, then conclude that they were never sent by God nor ordained by Him, but are unreasonable men whom ye Apostle desired ti be delivered from as not being in ye true faith”; (on side four is a lengthy postscript- also asks them to consider how peacably wee have behaved our selves under all governm[en]ts, both since and before ye King [Charles II] returned hom[e]… You know wee maintaine our owne poor and administer to yours also and pay our taxes to ye King as honestly as any… [and] therefore it is not your interest as men to destroy us in our persons and propertys only for difference in matters of religion, that being contrary to ye King[’s] promise to us before hee returned and to his Declaration since, butt ye maine cry for your ministers is that the Church is in danger”, which is totally false as fas as the “True Church” is concerned; see Matthew 16 and Acts 5: 34-40; even if “wee were proved to be Tares vizt the children… of ye wicked one, and your selves were ye Wheat vizt the children of God, you ought not to root us out from amongst you but lett us grow togither to ye end of ye world”; see Matt[hew] 13: 27-30

Contents: 
Love to him from Charles Marshal [Marshall] “who is here”, and from R.S. [Richard Snead], R.V. [Richard Vickris], C.J. [Charles Jones], C.H. [Charles Harford] and their wives; “These lines are sent to thee with the inclosed [see number 101] to answer the importunate pressing desire of an honest, tender hearted, yet weak woman, as to ye tendernes of whose spirit [he is referring to Mary Hampton; see number 101]…we are well satisfied, thou we could not close wth ye paper now sent as it is worded, or feel that thorow [thorough] open guidnace of the Truth”; therefore were unwilling “to have it communicated any further”; instead, have decided “to wait in ye motion of life, that it might bring forth what it moved for wth more clearnes”; unfortunatley, “she is in danger of running [into] an extremity of confusion and distraction if we did not hasten it away to thee, neither would she admit of that alteration or amendment of ye words as we could desire, so yt I saw no way but to intimte my intention of sending it, upon wch she hath had, as she saith, ease and satisfaction in her mind, so she leaves it to thee…that thou maist weigh and feel ye thing and order it was thous seest meet”; Friends there [Bristol] and in Wiltshire “are generally well and peacable, but here is so much filth and dirt, and an ill favour doth rise up in this city through ye loosnes and unfaithfullnes of many…professours of Truth [here he is referring to the Story-Wilkinson controversy, which also involved William Rogers of Bristol] that doth load and grieve the hearts of ye upright”; at the same time, Bristol “is like to be a place eminent for persecution wch ripens more and more, though we are little troubled with any oppositions or clashing in our meetings”; would like to hear “from thee concerning J.S. [John Story’s] letter wch he sent me, and since Friends think fit to reserve the printing of what I sent up to them [he is referring here to manuscript entitled “Esau Supplanted”, which the London Morning Meeting had expressed some doubts about] for a more convenient season, I desire that it might be sent to me. John Bringh[urst], ye printer may send it among Friends books to R.S. [Richard Snead]”; having difficulty in writing this “by reason of pain and weaknes in my head”

Will Caton and Jo. Stubs pasage in Holland [hand unidentified] in Olefere’s [Oliver Cromwell’s] dayes in London [this is by George Fox]

Contents: 
“About the twelfth day of the third month [May], [16](55)” the word of the Lord came to John Stubbs while he and William Caton were at Dover in Kent, that he should go to Holland, and the same word was received by William Caton, and therefore “about the first day of the fourth month [June]” they attempted to get shipping at Dover for Holland, “but at the tyme there was none from thence to goe”, so they travelled “about six ot seven score myles to Yarmouth”, where they enquired about shipping; they heard of a townsman who was going and a Friend spoke with him, but on hearing that they were Quakers, he said “he was for France” when in fact, “he went for Holland that voyage and tooke passengers alonge with him”; they made further enquiry and heard of another townsman “that was to goe after the other was gone” and spoke with him and he agreed that they could go; they waited some days for the wind “but when the tyme came yt he loosed his vessell from ye key and was headinge downe the river, he tould us he could not take us without a passe from the custom=house, though none that went had any (neither was it required of them)”; although their had been an order that none could go without a pass, the order was out of date “as one of the Bayliffs himself accknowledged”; yet “to the custome=house…one of us went in hast[e], together with an acquaintance” but they were not given a pass as it was alledged that “none might passe except merchants or seamen” but were told “that if wither of the bayliffes would grant us one, he would give it forth”; they went to the bailiff “and he tould us here was no such thinge required, the M[aste]r of the shipp needed not to be soe curious, and severall other expressions he used (with a seeminge moderation though in deceipt as afterwards appeared) but a passe we could not have”; they went again to the m[aste]r of the vessell but “some of the owners tould us it was to no purpose to speake further, for he would not carry us, for the owners thought much and rather then the master would displease them, he would breake his p[ro]misse with us”; yet they were soon informed of another townsman and their friend spoke with him and he promised them passage; therefore “when the wind served, wee went aboard in his owne boate and by his order and he returned into the towne againe, and there he came to understand what we were and how that others had refused us. Therefore he would not take us, but when he came to call for the boate to bring him aboard, hee caused his men to bringe us ashore though we were under sayle and had beene aboard four or five howers”; thus they were denied “the liberty of freeborne Englishmen” and they spent “three weekes or twenty dayes…therabouts”; decided to speak “for a shipp that miight convey us to Newcastle, but him called the M[aste]r of the vessell tould us he could not take us without a passe…and the bayliffe who before shewed moderation…refused to graunt us a passe, though it was for our owne country…but notwithstanding it was soe ordered that we went towards newcastle in the said shipp and soe came saf[e]ly into the north”; waited there “about fifteene or sixteene dayes; then it was generally reported that the plague was much in Holland and that an order was come downe from London that if any came from thence into England, they were to stay twenty dayes aboard before the[y] came ashore (which caused some jeolosies and feares amongst the sea=men) but these reports did not discourrage us, but we chearfully resolved to goe”; several days later they heard of a ship which was to go either for Flaunders “which is under the dominion of Spaine” or for Holland and they went aboard “and after certaine dayes sayle, we came to Yarmouth Roads” where the m[aste]r of the vessel resolved to go for Flanders “and by p[rp]vidence there was another shipp in the Roades which intended for Flushing in Holland, upon wch we were set aboard, and did saf[e]ly arrive at Flushinge the next day”; went ashore along with the master of the vessel who helped them secure lodging and the next day they went into the streets and market where they “ p[ro]clayme[d] the mighty day of the Lord”; afterwards, “the preist and clerke of an English church (as they call it) reasoned together with some others and sent a messenger unto us to enquire if we would come to their church and that if we came we might observe their order, wch was to bull of[f] our hatts at their prayers, and singing of Psalmes, but litle satisfac[i]on he did receive from us, neither would we make any coven[an]t wtf death”; the next day “being the first day of the weeke”, the clerk came again, in the morning, and beseeched them not to come out of fear of the danger that might ensue “unlesse we would behave ourselves as they did”; nonetheless, they went and after all was ended, “one of us began to speake, but the preist said, ‘Sirrah, you should have put of[f] your hatt’, and came running hastily downe without his hatt or gloves to prevent us”, all which stirred up the people “in soe much that they did violently fall upon us after the same manner that hath beene often practized in England” and in fact the first man “that laid hand of us” was from Dover, in England “for he knew us and said he had enough of us, and he wth some others (but especially the Scotts) did offer much abuse to us” but the Lord hindered them; however, “after we were returned to our lodginge, the man of the house did hasten us much away, both from his house and alsoe out of the towne…and about halfe an hower after wee were gone, came to sarjeants…to apprehend us”; had movings to go to Midlborrow [Middlburg] especially as the priest in the former town [Flushing] “did declaree in the pulpitt to the congregation yt it was in the magisterates power to apprehend us and not only soe, but also to put us to death, and brought severall scriptures to prove it”; at Midlborrow they knew none either by face or name “and the language of a few did wee there understand, nor they owers [ours], and havinge walked a while in the streets, we mett wth a Scotch=man who took us into his house and said he would give us lodging for our money, and after we had beene a litle space in his house, we enquired where the meetinge of the English and the Scotch people was, soe when they went to it, wee went alonge…and after yt all was ended,…one of us stood up to speake” desiring the same priviledge “that was practiced in ye Church of Christ, which was that if anythinge were revealed to him that stood by, the first was to hould his peace” but the high priest said they should not speak; “Neverthelesse the one of us spoke on wch did the more torment the preist…and soe they hayled us forth after the same man[n]er that wee were in the foornoone at the other place”; now spoke in the street “till that one man came violently and begun to beat him that was speakinge” but the Lord prevented further abuse and they passed on the streets apeaking to the people, and “there passed by a coach with some great ones in it [and] one of them, beinge filled with indignation against us did hastily take his rapier to have exercised his bloody intent upon us, but his hands was shortened and he was taken away”; they continued along the streets before returning to the Scotchman’s house “where our lodginge should have beene, but he, together wth his wife, was full of rage and fury agt us, and would upon no tearmes let us stay under their roofe, but tould us that watch was set at every port for us”; were forced to wander the streets for no one would accept their money to lodge them; then “a man came after us, whom we knew not, nor he us by face, who went to severall houses wth us to p[ro]cure us lodginge, and in the end we came to one who did receive us for our money”; the next morning, one of those who had set upon them in the streets came to their lodging and apologized, “and he with some others came from the preist who was waitinge for us to come to his house to speake wth him, for he would have knowne by what authority we came in to their church to speake amongst them wthout leave, but before this, wee had beene moved to write some queries to the preist, with a paper to the two churches…at which we had beene p[er]secuted to lay open their nakednesse, and to let them see themselves to be out of the practice of the S[ain]ts”; went to the preist “who had assembled his Elders together, and when …we came to his house, he did much welcome us with flatteringe speeches and outward behaviour in their heathenish salutations in imitation of the Saints, which they are ignorant of”, but the priest was soon enraged “because we did not bow to him”; some about him took his part “and pleaded for him" but they were comprehended in the Light “and at that tyme we left them in great heat and rage, and that night tooke shipping for the citty called Roterdam [Rotterdam]”; were directed to an Englishman’s house “who did p[ro]cure us lodginge”; while in the lodging, “wee imploye’d ourselves wth writing pap[er]s and givinge them abroad when we had an opportunity…and severall we scattered in the streets”; “The next day, the English marchant (or broker soe called) came to us and tould us we might have an opportunity to declare our minds the day followinge at his house, for there was some that would heare us” but when the time came, he again came to their lodging and told them that none had some and therefore “the meetinge would be voyd”; one of them passed through the streets but little was spoken; this “we enquired when any shipp would be ready for England, for we had present freedome to come away, for severall Englishmen had beene wth us and they had received papers and queries from us,…and a Duch [Dutch] preist or two had beene with us and the woman of the house did interprett our language to them and theirs to us,…and in the meantyme the afforesaid Englishman came to us againe and tould us there was some come to his house, and soe he would have had us to have gone alonge wth him, and we did soe, and severall great ones were there, a house full of people, marchants and other great men of the citty”; spoke to them and “most of them confessed wee spoke the Truth” although their was some contention; returned again to the town of Midlborrow [Middelburg] “and some came to see us and desired some papers of us, and we endeavored to give to as many as we saw…and sent some to their church…and we were informed…that the preists had beene together, that is to say, the Dutch preists in Midlborrow and him called the pastor of the English church, and did incense the people agt us…[and] another day, we beinge in the streets, they afforesayd preist wth some others, came unto us with a refyned subtillty, askinge us how we did and where we had beene, and how it was with us, for he said, he was gladd to see us well, but wee denyed his flatteryes and tould him it was deceipt, and after some litle discourse in the streets, they urged it much upon us to goe into one of their houses”; agreed to go in and there the priest queried them, but after a while “they concluded we were cunninge and crafty because we did not answere their questions accordinge to their wills”; thus, “wee [were] delivered and preserved, and came away in peace”

Thomas Thurston, Josiah Cole and Thomas Chapman passage from Virginia to New England through the indians wher never befor anywere knowne to goe, [16]58, 6m [August], 2 [day], entred by B.B. [Benjamin Bealing?]

Contents: 
Left Verginia [Virginia] on the “2d, 6th month [August], [16]58” and after travelling about 100 miles, they came “amongst the Susquehanas [Susquehanna] indians who courtiously receved us and entertayned us in theyr huses [“houses” appears to have been crossed out and “huts” written above] with much respect, and from that place, after two or three dayes being ther with diet frae [free], severall of them acompanied us abut [about] 200 miles farther through ye wildernes or woods, for ther was noe inhabitant in soe farr togather, neyther knew wee any part of the w[ay] through that desert...and for outward sustinance wee knew not how to supy our selves”; yet the indians “in all times of need...were...helpfull to us, both to cary us through rivers of water and alsoe to suply us with food sufitient [sufficient] (though they made hard shift for it)...in soe much that wee had noe want of anything they could gett for us”; thus after travelling 300 miles “wee came to a place wher more of them inhabited, and they alsoe...very kindly entertayned us in theyr houses, wher[e] wee remayned about 16 days by reason my felow travell[er] [Thomas Thurston] was weake of bodye through sicknes and lamenes, in which time thes[e] indians shewed very much respect to us, for they gave us freely of the best they could gett and alsoe...bound up the wonds [wounds] of my felow traveler which caused his lamenes, and being somthing recovered after this stay, wee pased on towards the Dutch Plantation, to which place one of them acompanied us wch was about 100 miles further” [on side two, a different had has added additional information on this epsode- “Whilst T Thirston was sick, the indians would goe forth some houres into the woods to seek for wild turkyes to make broth for him wch they make of their corne dryed and beate to dust [and?] wet night and day 10 dayes togather. When they [Coale et al] were within 50 miles of the Mando’s [most probably this refers to the Mantua creek in New Jersey, which at that time was spelled ‘Manto’], T Thirston was soe sick yt hee could not pass any further, whereupon they were constrayn[e]d to abide ther six dayes, dureing wch time the indian (because ther were noe indians nere inhabiting in yt country) went (wth T. Chapman) to the Manotu’s [Mantua; see above] and brought from thence [this refers to the Dutch fort on Mantua creek] sack, bread and butter wth other provisions wch wee bought ther[e] and brought to him”]; on coming among the Dutch, the latter “put us in prison and kept [us] ther som howers tell towards evening, and then cam[e] with souldiers and caried my frend [Thomas Thurston], who was not well and pulled mee along to a boate and banished us over to a serten island [unidentified] wher[e] dwelt som few families of ye Dutch, but they gave them command not to carie us of[f] the island, neyther t[o] entertayn us”; remained on that island for several days “and being neare the water side, wee found som[e] indians pasin [passing] on ye water in a boat, and wee lett them kno our condition, and alsoe desired them to carie us...to Long Island, which they did, though at the first they were unwil[ling] by reson the Dutch had insenced them agaynst us”; the Dutch “marveled how wee cam[e] through amongst them [the indians], for if they should goe...a litle way from theyr palntations, the indians would kill the”; in fact, “wee found more favor and Christians lik[e] carage amongst them [the indians] who releeved us in our nessessity, then wee did amongst ye Dutch...who banished us and denied to lett us have one night’s lodging in theyr towne for ou[r] mony, or to pas through theyr town”; on coming to Long Island “wee found som Frends in Truth”; however at that time, “I [Josiah Coale, who is writing this account] parted with my companion [Thomas Thurston; there is no further word on Thomas Chapman in this account], hee being not of ability in body to travell on soe fast as itt lay upon mee to goe, and after about 150 miles travell on that island [Long Island], I crosed over by water to the mayn land, wher[e] I came among the indians agayn, who was always very caurtious to direct mee the way and to suply mee with any thing I needed”; travelled another 50 miles and came to Road [Rhode] Island but “after som stay there, I was moved to goe to ta serten island (in New Ingland [England]) caled Martens [Martha’s] Vinyard [Vineyard] to visit som indians ther...and I had a meeting amongst them and they were very loving to mee and tould mee they much desired to know God, and afterwards at another place neare Plimouth [Plymouth] coleney I was amongst the indians, amongst whom was true breathings after ye knowledg[e] of God, who sayd to mee it was an ould word amongst ye English to talke of God, but syad hee [possibly the chief], ‘wee can never see him yeat’, and after the Inglish had prisoned mee [Josiah Coale] att Plymouth, and sett mee att liberty agayne, I cam to ye indian Sagamore’s [the supreme head or chief of some American indian tribes] hous[e] (nere Plimmouth Colony)...who sayd that the Englishmen did not love Quakers, but sayd, ‘Quakers are honest men and doe noe harme, and this is noe Englishman’s sea nor land, and Quakers shall com[e] here and [be] welcom[e]’, soe through ye goodnes of the Lord wee found them more sober and christian  like in theyr carage towards us at all ocations hen wee found the Christians soe called”

Some Friends followed, and the other in hasting lost one another, soe they weare parted in three [with] the two men…togither, and the other each alone, and the two men was found next day and went to a Inne, and soe yesterday N.J.

Ye Women hath kept their meeting all this time pretty well. W[illia]m Rogers hath not given the money yt belongs to poor Freinds, they say it is about 300 pounds. Here is severall things yt might be amended and it is a very seasonable time, for none of ye seperat[e] company comes to ye meetings for buesynes now”; prays to the Lord “yt He may give ye [thee] streignth in thy body yt ye things that are behinde yu may sett in order when ye comes and it were well if some men and women came with ye.

I said prety much to him and he concluded with me, s[ay]ing he intended to be at Bristol. He said nothing to me [of] my paper which was sent to him before. I hope ye hast… write to John Bye [Buy] to bring it or send it to ye. I purpose after some time to goe to Cirencester and Glocester [Gloucester] and Freinds [torn] bene in long sufferings”; would like “to see ye… or to heare from ye”; (Postscript- “Edward Martindale hath served W[illia]m Rogers in Chancery and Wm seekes to have it ended.

Lengthy pastoral beginnning praising the wonderous works of the Lord; "I shall now declare unto thee ye p[ar]ticulers of my p[ro]ceedings in Holland after I landed at Rotterdam. I remained thear som[e] few dayes finding littell to doe, only a rumour theare was about ye citty yt I was com[e] and som[e] reported yt I was a Jesuite and many threatning speeches was given out agt [against] me...but I finding my worke not to be theare at yt time, departed from thence to Middelburgh [Middelburg] in Zeeland [Zealand]...wch was about 60 English miles, but I haveing ben theare at at Flishing [Flushing] about two dayes, I was prest in my spirit to pass to Amsterdam (wch was about 102 English miles) wheare I remained som[e] few dayes and then I found som[e] drawings to pass to ye meeting place of ye English upon ye first day wthin ye citty and when I came theare I sate down amongst som[e] yt seemed to be zealous in theire way wch were speaking one to another of Christ and of faith, but after a short time, I was moved to speake amongst them whearat they seemed to be astonished and owned my words and desired me to stay and heare theire minister, but I having severall bookes about me wch suffitiently declared w[ha]t theire minister was and all his generation, I left them amongst them and departed, and hearing of a meeting of English Brownists thither I went and after the man yt was speaking had don[e], I began to speak, but he who had spoken came himselfe from ye highest place in ye assembly with another and thrust me out and shutt ye door to keep me out (at which som[e] of his owne members were offended), and after this I continued certaine days in yt citty, much wearyed in my spirit and nevertheless had no freedom to pass from thence but one day passing along ye street, a seaman mett me, whom before to my knowledge I never saw and he tolde me yt in ye citty theare was a woman wch was a friend of mine and moreover he tolde me he would enquire wheare shee lodged...wch ye next day by his meanes I found, but shee was gon in her journey towards England, but ye sayde seaman tolde me of another who was so accounted wch came from London about som[e] outward occasions, but he was gon[e] som[e] parte of ye way wth her, but he suddenly returned and when he came he tolde me of a people yt were very neer ye Truth, so we past together unto them and desired a meeting wch was granted wheare I had liberty to declare and severall received my testimony [the meeting may have been that of the Flemish Mennonites and among those who received the Truth at that time may have been Jacob Williamson Sewell and Judith Zinspenning, the parents of William Sewell; see William Hull, The Rise of Quakerism in Amsterdam, 1655-1665, pp. 94-94], so in a short space it was noised about ye citty and severall meetings I had and many opposers came, but they were taken in theire owne snares and confounded. From thence, I past to Harelem [Haarlem], a citty about 9 English miles from thence whear I had two meetings and not without severall contenders, but they were taken as ye former and the Truth was made manifest. From thence I past to Rotterdam (wch is about 30 English miles) wheare I had a large meeting and few opposers. From thence I past to a towne called Vlaeden [Vlaardingen?] (wch is 6 English miles) wheare I had a meeting and severall owned the Truth and then I returned to Rotterdam and had another meeting wheare the contenders were so made manifest that a seperation began to be betwixt those that owned the Truth and the contenders, and a silent meeting was determined. From thence I returned to Amsterdam (wch is about 42 English miles) wheare severall meetings I had and many were convinced and likewise severall of Middelburgh [Middelburg] wch is about 3 miles distant and then I had thoughts of passing for England, a shipp being neere ready, wch was bound for Newcastell [Newcastle], but in the meane time I received thy letter with wch my soule was refreshed, which signifyed to me that John Stubbs was coming to me. Then was I moved to returne to Amsterdam (wch is about 105 English miles) and the[a]r being com[e], I found John Stubbs (wch meeting by me will never be forgotten) and severall meetings we had in that citty and wonderfully was the power of God made manifest and the opposers of the Truth confounded. From thence we past to Haerlem [Haarlem] whear a pure seed we found and having declared oure message, we returned the same day to Amsterdam. Afterwards we past to a place called Sardam [Zaandam] wheare we were received with much love and not long after we past to a citty called Alckwaer [Alkmaar] whear severall received us, and a pure seed theare we found. From thence to Haerlem we past...and from thence we past to Rotterdam wheare severall meetings we had...and from thence we past to Utrucht [Utrecht] wheare with great love we were received...From thence we past into Zeeland [Zealand] and at Flishing we had a meeting consisting of severall sorts of people but all chayned by the Eternal power that although the meeting was very large yet not one word objected, and from thence in the eternall freedom we past to the shipp accompanied with severall Freinds (great in the outward), som[e] lamenting oure departure, others hoping for the coming of som[e] other out of England to direct theire mindes that they might be established in the Truth...We have ben with George [Fox] and weare to pass into Ireland and from thence through Scotland and into Flanders and through Holland and into Jermany [Germany] and much I see of passing into Denmark”

"I formerly understanding that oure dear brother William Caton had given thee an account of passages in my travells, [I] did omitt to write unto thee soe largely myselfe as otherwise I should and ought to have don[e], but I understanding thy desire in thy last to W.C. [William Caton], I shall...proceed to give thee a brief account”; after passing from Amsterdam, he headed towards the Paltz [Pfalz], but on the way, he stopped in Holland and Coln [Koln i.e. Cologne] where he had some service “for the sound of Truth hath ben much among [them], to wit, in Gelderland and Cleveland, where many Baptists dwells” but although he went among them and several have been convinced, “yet little is brought forth”; from there he passed towards the Pfaltz [Pfalz] “having littel service by the way”, and after spending some time with Friends, passed to Heidelburgh [Heidelburg] “to visit the Prince...and to give him severall volum[e]s, as well Latin as English and Dutch, which I judged might be best for him, which in Holland I had caused to be bound up for him. And coming into the citty, the Captaine of of {{unsure if this is a transcription error or if the repetition is in the letter--CW}} his lifeguard saw me in the street [and] though there were others in his company, not of the meanest, yet he readily came...[to] manifest his great affection towards me, takeing me by  the hand in the street and desire[ing me to pass] to his house, which accordingly I did”; that same evening, the Prince, hearing of his arrival, “sent a servant with a torch to light me up to his palace, and when I came there he told mee I was wellcom[e] and began to aske me what I thought of that report conserning Friends riseing against the King [Charles II]. I tolde him I knew it was a false report and many moderate words past bet[ween] us to that purpose, he shewing me the Diurnall printed in English, for it was just about that time, but I could not see that he was very ready to beleeve any such thing of us, and after the Captaine of his guard saide that he had written (to witt, the Capt[ain]) to a good friend for the certainty of the matter and had received answere that we were innocent in it. Soe after supper (after I had given him the bookes which he gladly received), he caused [me] to follow him into another roome, where in the presence of them all...I had freedom to declare that which was in my heart to him, shewing him the Truth on the one side, and on the other side, the wickednes of the priests, the falsnes of [their] doctrine, the unjustnes of tithes and the sufferings of my Friends in that country, which he heard without seeming to be offended at all, but asked me whether I did not know that [pr]iests were needfull as to the upholding of theire politique goverment. Then I shewed him that  they were the men who were destructive to good goverment and I alsoe manifested the [lo]ve of Friends towards him...which seemed to please him”; he [Ames] now desired to head for his lodging which was outside the city but feared that the gates would be shut, whereupon he [the Prince] appointed someone “to accompany me with a torch to my lodgeing and to cause the gates to be opened for me”; the next day, “I desireing to know whether he had any thing more to say to me, he sent me word that if I did com[e] to visit him, I should be wellcom[e], but as for that which he had to say to me, I need not stay”; while in that country, he [Ames] also had good service with a countis [countess] “soe called in English” who proved to be moderate and did love them [Friends] for their goodness but was “not soe convinced as in all things to join with us, but doth hang to the priest, not for theire goodness but because of theire cerimonyes. Truth in that country hath a great dominion though few com[e] into the obedience of it as yet”; from there he passed towards Bohemia, searching the country as he went but found “an enmity raysed in most peopel [ag]ainst the very name of Quakers, for that wicked report [of the Quaker rebellion against Charles II; see above] was spread over all the countryes in print”; did have ample opportunity to declare the Truth but while several confess it to be the Truth, “yet it had so littel entrance upon them and affected soe littel with them that I shall omitt to enlarge upon that”; notes that the inhabitants of each of those countries follows the religion of their rulers; thus Lutheran rulers have Lutheran subjects, with the exceptions being papists and Jews amongst whom he had little service; instead he passed towards Brandenburgh [Brandenburg] and then into Pomerania in order to take shipping for Dantzick [Danzig], and on coming into the latter, he found, in a short time, he was “much knowne, and had very great service in that place”; the first meeting he had there “was in the field and [was] pretty large and sti[ll] and severall thear are convinced; afterwards we had another meeting in a wood, but after that we got a house to meet in”; after that “we past (for it is to be understood that in all this journy I had a Friend [Jan Hendricks; see William Hull, The Rise of Quakerism in Amsterdam 1655-1665, pp. 67-79] of the Pfaltz [Pfalz] with me, for they were not at all free that I should goe alone) towards Poland about 6 or 7 schore [shore] myles up into the country and had service at severall [pla]ces amongst Baptists, but they are a very wicked people notwithstanding theire profession, and the inhabitants of Poland are much like unto the Ireish [Irish] people, being enclined...but alsoe living in all wickednes and especially drunckennes, adultery and murder [and] soe hear are many of them called gentlemen who through the warrs have lost theire estates and...have a law that if a gentlemen killeth his subject, there can be noe more demanded of him but 2 rich daelders [rix-dollars] which is less then 10s, and they who are tolerated by a law to k[ill] subjects doe rather chuse to kill strangers to get what they have if they can light upon them”; after speaking the Truth to those who could understand him, he returned back towards Dantzick [Danzig] which city was in an uproar over them [Ames and Hendricks] as the magistrates had sought for him after he had gone to Poland and intercepted some letters sent to him from Holland “with a pretty great parcell of bookes in Dutch” and warnings were issued as to what the magistrates would do to him should they get him; yet, “I took the intercepting of the bookes and letters as [an] occasion given for me to goe to them [the magistrates]...which accordingly I did, but was not permitted to apeare before them all, but [was] sent to one of the Burgemeester’s [Burgomaster’s] houses to stay there till he came”; when he came “with another”, he was “something rough” at first, but by the time they were ready to part, “they seemed very friendly, asking simpely the truth of many thing[s] where with we were slaundered, soe after long discours, they restored my letters to me and did seem to be confounded that they had broke them open, but my bookes they saide I should not have, fearing I would spread them, but I desired they would let me have one which they bid me take, but after a little longer discourse, he bid me take soe many as I would. Then I tolde him I should distribute them if they gave me more then that one (for that was one newly printed which [I] desired to see and tolde them I thought not to part with it there). He saide I might take them not withstanding, which I did, and instead of being churlish and stubborn, they rose up from theire seats to conduct me out of the house”; after coming from them, “great was the dominion of Truth and such who before feared to speak with me were glad of the opertunity, and they who were convinced were strengthened...and bookes much inquired for”; he then took shipping for Holland; “I was alsoe with one of the chiefe priests of that citty [Danzig] and had much conferrence [with] him”

Her beauty and comeliness shine "through countries and nations" and her fame "spreads through the earth"; often they feel her embrace her and are refreshed with her; earnestly desire to hear from her; "Wee have writen twice since wee wear cast into prison to thee, but wee have not yeat [yet] recieved any of thine"; have been in bonds for 8 weeks "and our p[er]secutors are even ashamed of theire actions and would galdly bee quit of us, but would...have us to submit a litle to theire wills"; a week previously the sheriff came to them in prison "and hee was even as meeke as a lambe and staid an houre with us and wee had som[e] dispute with him,...and hee used all the arguments and p[er]swasions yt posibly might bee to have us yeeld to bee bond, if it weare but one for another, and to goe forth and tould us yt wee hindered our owne designe with staying heare, and said in this time wee might have converted many to God if wee had beene at liberty and tould us yt Jason put in securitie for himselfe and others but not for Paull and wee tould him wee weare not free to ingage, for wee had wronged noe man nor transgressed any law...and soe he passed away very loveing and saif hee would yt the priests and wee might have a dispute together yt Truth might appeare and wee desired him to speake to the priests not heard anything form him since"; have been kept in prison all this time without a mittimus [warrant of committal] "for the gaoler hath nothing but a piece of paper in which it is artien as followeth, 'Ric[hard] Roper and Richard Waller ro finde suerties to reside and not to wander and pay fees 13 s[hillings], 4d [pence] a pece,' wheareof 10 s to the Judg[e], and the[y] had this paper 5 weekes and noe man's hand at it and then the gaoler, as he saith, got one to Cliff to subscribe his name to it, who the[y] say is the clerke of the court"; at present "heare is an ould woman, a deare Friend, [who] was moved to com[e] from Dubline [Dublin] to visit us" and whose name is Lettiz [Lettice] Shaine [Shane]; she has done 'much servise for the Truth in goeing amongst the great ones of the earth to lay Friends sufferings beefore them, both in England and Ireland. She hath beene of Oliver P[rotector i.e. Oliver Cromwell] hous[e] and hath often laid Friends sufferings beefore him, and shee was moved to goe to the Maior of this towne and to the sherife and lay our sufferings on them, and both of them denied it and laid the blame upon the Judg[e] and said it was his order"; therefore it is likely that "when shee com[e]s to Dubline againe, shee will la the thing beefore ye judg[e] to see if he will owne it, then "to lay his unjust deallings beefore the Counsaill [Council], but truely shee is a very ould woman and very weake and sickly in body, and trully one should scarsly beeleeve yt shee weare able to travill either on foote or horseback soe fare [far] as betwixt Dubline and this place, for it is 60 miles"; have sent a book "by this bearer" which might be serviceable "if it weare printed and sent into this nation [Ireland]"; Friends there "are very free and tender over us" and would even "ly downe life for us [and] wee have liberty to goe to theire meetings 3 times a weeke"; have need of nothing in the putward at present; two other Friends in bonds there "desires to bee remembered to thee", both of whom are in "for speaking to the priest, and the one is fined 20 s[hillings]" but the other is "newly cast in and hath not had his tryall, but hee spooke in the time of the priest's exercise, soe it's like the[y] will fine him too"; they [Roper and Waller] were at a meeting "in this cittie [Waterford] ...[and] some Friends confesed the life was never so raysed in them as it was yt day, and there was a man come from about Limerick" whose name was John Browne [Brown] and who "is an inhabiter in this nation and seems he goes up and downe amongst Freinds and speakes words, but is ignorant of the power. He delt exceedinge tretcherously with us, for he seemed to be loveinge to us and came to the prison to us to visit us, and then went away into the countery and tould Freinds that there weare two deceivers come out of Eingland of James Nayler's followers and he writ letters to severall meetings in this nation to this purpose and writ to them to take heed of us and writt to them that Freinds might one write to another, and soe he thought to have spred this thinge thorrow the nation, but...Elizebeth Morgen [Morgan] met with one of his letters at a Freind's house where shee was in the countery and soe shee cleared our inocency and tould Freinds hee kneew us not, and shee sent to Freinds and stopped his letters. After this, shee met with this John Browne at a meetinge and reproved him openly and asked him if hee had done as he would have bene done by. He was ashamed and had nothinge to say for himselfe, and shee tould him yt to every place yt he had written and owne condemnation upon itt [butt] he tould her he could not doe yt"; therefore "our sufferings are great", having often "suffered inocently in Eingland [England] and...have beene in p[er]ills by sea and perills by land and in p[er]ills by false breetheren"; John Craven whom "wee met with at Dublin" and of whom "we writ to thee,...is come to Charles Collins' to live. I hope it will bee good for him if he keepe in silence untill the life speake"; to bretheren have "come over to Eingland [and] they intended when they weare with us to come and see thee"; Charles Collines [Collins] and Robert Turner "have forsaken much for they [the] Truth and Robert Turner hath stood a faithfull wittnes for the Lord and suffered much imprisonment. Charles Collines is one yt is great in the outward [and] ...hath beene severall times heare to visit us [and] his wofe allso came with him"; have heard that G.F. [George Fox] "was in the north.

So as Xt wee recieved ye one way, ye one truth, ye one life and in Him keep our simplicity, Godly sincerity and unity. here is no room allowed for opposition and contrariety, nor no possibility for one man to plead his conscience againe another man's conscience, they both being in the unity held in ye Light of Xt, but wee find tis such as are gone out from it into singularity, self conceit, prejudice (against persons who are the servants of Xt). It is such yt are quarrelling against things although never so constant wth Scriptures"; as for "thy assenting such oposers of Truth to be professirs of Truth,...yt's false whose works have made them manifest to be gone from the Truth...and out of the unity,...and therfore such cannot weaken the work and service in Xt's church and gospell order"; "I wish while thou pretends to discover the enimies of Sion's peace to others, thou could see him aspiring in thy...mind"; however, wishes that "if thou come back thither not exersing dominion as a master in Xt's school, but as a schollar in humility, thou wilt look over my impertinences, as thou may term them, and read me as one yt hath obtained favour wth God...to bear my testimony against yt false Sp[iri]t and ye propagation of it, be it by man or woman"; "Alas poor woman, while thou in thy aspiring, presumptious, self-will'd, conceited, heady, high min[d] art falsly charging ye servants of the Lord wth sophistry, dark chambers pf imagery, and all, as thou thinks, bespeaks ym gone out from ye truth and holy simplicity of Xt Gospell, thou little seest this to be thy very own condition,...and as thy paper specifie[s] of they approver yt caused from some malicious author to reprint under thy name, as if thou could not find defaming, scurilous matter enough of thy own against ye servants of Xt"; it is a shame that "the good example of Giles Barnadiston's [Barnardiston's] humility and quiet subjection in ye life of Truth hath no more impresion upon thee, and also ye patern of thy sister's quiet conversation. As to thy verses, I must needs tell the[e] there is a ranting woman, her name's Elizabeth Rone. She was a companion of the old Ranter John Taylor yt hanged himself in prison. This woman for many years, wth such very matter as is thy verses, singing at our meeting house door in opposition of truth and to disturb us in our peacible religious exercise...I with thy matter had not given me occasion of such an instance...[but] thy will hath been at work in itt"; "be not elevate wth false conceits of others; neither do thou elevate others wth thine"; (postscript- "How envious, defaming and scurilous thy whole matter is stated against G.F. [George Fox] and my husband [George Whitehead] and Tho[mas] Ellwood by the words wthin ye crothets [i.e. square brackets]. Whether thou own them or no thy name is to ym. If thou own them not, thou ought to write and print publikly ag[ain]st ym [see number 236] as being forged in thy name. If thou ownest ym, then thou ownest a defaming and scandalous charge ag[ain]st the Friends and servants of Xt above named and yn [then] in thy whole pamphlet thy self constardiction doth plainly manifest thy conceited folly and hypocrisie in thy late pretences ag[ain]st printing controversies and thy love to and esteem of G.F. and for his not appearing in print")

Contents: [The certificate by Christopher Taylor and Thomas Dockrey]- They affirm "that in Hartford [Hertford], we heard G.F. [George Fox] speak many things concerning ye danger of youth, in a way of Godly care, lest youth should runn out of ye order and government of Truth into a false liberty, in running disorderly together in marriage, and also in their conversations, and quoted something to yt purpose, which in his travells in severall parts of this nation he had observed. 1st, concerning loose marriages and disorderly, and 21y, concerning loose conversation under a pretence of liberty so to doe, but that ever wee heard him speak of a couple takeing each other in marriage saying, 'M[aste]r [John] Story, I take such a woman to be my wife', and ye woman to say, 'M[aste]r Story, I take this man to bee my husband', and after to put off their hatts, and say, 'Here is to M[aste]r Story'...which things Nichollas Lucas accused G.F. of, and proudly arraigned him for itt, as he called itt, and brought his confederates to prove itt att ye house of William Fairmans [Fairman] in Hartford [Hertford] ye 5 of 8 m. [October], 1680. And that he should speak such things as above accused of, wee afirme we never heard from him to ye best of our remembrance, though some of us were farr more conversant with G.F. att yt time at Hertford, when they say he spoak such things, then they were who accused him"; also affirm that "God...is with him [G.F.]...to h=guide and direct him in yt great service He hath appointed him for, and wee doe fully beleive that if he [G.F.] could remember that any such thing was spoken by him at any time, either in Hartford or thereawayes, that he in noe wise would deny itt, soe just, so good and so true a man and servant of...God we know him to bee"; in addition, "many honest Fr[ien]ds in Hartford...are in unity with this our testimony"; [the certificate from S.G.]- witnesses to the truth of one part of the paper, viz., "the testimony borne therein for G.F., and ye falsity of ye other p[ar]t, vizt. that he never spoak ye words therein charged against him in my hearing, being an eare witness at sundry times and in divers places to what G.F. spake in ye perticuler things therein mentioned"; also has "a clearer testimony in my heart for that holy servant of ye Lord...then all his gainsayers can have against him"; [there follows a paper or letter of T.D. [Thomas Dockray, which is virtually identical to numbers 200 and 212 combined]; [there follows a paper or letter signed by Thomas Dockrey [Dockray] and Christopher Taylor]- note that "it was asked Rich[ard] Martin and Hen[ry] Stout and his wife [Mary nee Saunders] and Abraham Rutt [Rudd] and his wife [Frances], Rich[ard] Thomas and his wife [Hannah] and W[illia]m Faiman and his wife [Ellin or Elinor] and Christopher Taylor and Tho[mas] Dockrey [Dockray] whether ever they heard G.F. speak such things as H[enry] Sweeting and his wife [Ann] and daughters [probably Elizabeth and Sarah] and N[icholas] Lucas and Ma[ry] Beale and Tho[mas] Moss and Ed[ward] Perkens [Parkin] did falsely accuse him with etc., and they all denyed that they has heard him speak such things. And likewise a private letter being sent to Hen[ry] Stout from G.F. and Ann Whitehead, which Mary Stout simply let a woman have,...and contrary to Hen[ry] Stout's minde and Mary's, unknowne to ym, they privately stole a coppy of itt, which Tho[mas] Beale produced in a meeting agt G.F. and never spoak to him privately of itt, it being a private letter,...and G.F. asked whether it was ye originall coppy or not and after much adoe they said noe. It was asked if it was a true coppy. Some said yes,...and when G.F. tooke it into his hand and saw itt, he said it was his letter and was not ashamed of itt, and then N[icholas] Lucas was in a great rage agt G.F. to have it againe and bid G.F. give him itt againe, and said, 'give mee my goods! Wilt thou keep my goods away from mee?', and said it was his goods, etc. though N[icholas] Lu[cas] and some of his company had stolen that coppy of G.F. and A.W. letter"; C[hristopher] Taylor asked N[icholas] Lucas, "when he had ye paper in his hand, whether it was ye originall coppy or not, he being about to present it to ye meeting agt G.F. by way of inditement,...then N. Lucas in a great fury and rage, bid C.T. sitt downe or get him out of ye house (though it was another man's), saying to him, 'Thou art a silly fellow'", and also saying to G.F. "in a wicked, boisterous manner, 'now thou art arreigned', with other abusive, malicious words"; however, "God will arraigne Nicholas Lucas for his impudence and wickedness, except he speedily repent"

On the 13th day of the 7th month [September], “I was arreasted by a writt of quitam [qui tam i.e. an action brought on a penal statute by an informer, who sues for the penalty both on his own behalf and on that of the crown] for £120 for not comeing to the Ste[e]plehouse, and since that time they have alsoe taken William Grave and Bryan Lancaster upon the like account. Wee are yett att the bayliff’s house in Kendall [Kendal], but tomorrow, itt is reported wee must goe to Apleby [Appleby] goale. There is sone more Friends in the same writt, as John Pearson and who else we know not. They have severall of the Presbyterians in the same writt and itt is served upon 3 of them, but they doe forwith [forthwith] put in appearance and then conforms with all speed and goes to the Steplehouse. Freinds in Apleby goale unto to whom wee must goes… are all well, not onely in bodily health, but also in heavenly unitye”; [there follows a lengthy passage confirming their faith in the Lord, and also praising the work of George Fox]; “And though all maner of evill have beene spoaken of thee [George Fox] or against thee for God’s name’s sake, yett thou arte blessed of the Lord because thou arte of Abraham’s faith and of Jacob’s seed and Israell’s offspring in whose princely power and living dominion the Seed reignes over the power of darknesses”; meetings have been “as large as ever” and the Truth prospers, which has caused the adversaries “to be angrye… and breake forth now of late in our countye more then of late years”; Edward Wilson, “called Justice, hath of late sent his owne man servant with severall others to Preston meeting to become informers and he hath made convictions thereof and given for[th] warrants and this weeke, they have destreaned [distracted] goods on the 4th daye of the weeke, and sould them on the 5th daye and brought in the King’s [Charles II] part the 6th date to the Quarter Sessions, £20 for the house and £20 for an unknowne preacher, which was laud upon hearers, besides there perticular fines. Thomas Dockerye [Dockray] was him they called an unknowne preacher, and he hath beene severall times since with the said Justice to make himselfe knowne, telling him he had an estate of his owne and that none shoul suffer for him, and Thomas hath beene verry nouble [noble] and cleared himselfe well and borne a good testemony for Truth before him, telling him he was the first Justice he knew… in all England that had put this Act a second time in execution. Wee found severall errors and illegall proceedings in there warrant, which might have occassioned and [an] appeale upon good ground, but that the face of things looks verry frowningly, and our persecutors judges in the matter, soe wee ly [lie] under itt. The parish Preist of Kendall [Michael Stanford] and the Deputye Shereefe hath beene and is the onely men for the stirring up these Quitams and they have gott a simple, ignorant mant to be an informer. William Grave hath an informer for his owne perticular, as wee perceive. Itt is the same Shereffe[‘s] Bayliffe that arreasted him. He hath kept him prisoner already eleven dayes. Now what law that is, that an informer may aprehend a man of £50 land in the year and keepe him prisoner in the informer’s owne house, and hitherto would never lett us see his warrant or mittimus, wee perceive itt is because he himselfe is informer, for he shewed me my warrant when I was aprehended. Our deare Freind being now in towne and wee telling him this passages, he hath tould us of an Habea Corpus Statute in which there is great penaltyes against the coaler [gaoler] for such doeings and wee have sent for the Statute. Wee shall have itt this daye. Yesterdaye wee had a verry large and pretious quarterly meeting, both ^of men and women”

Has been “a month and upward with J.A.

I was begune to declare beofr they came”; continued to speak for 3 hours and “they satt like dead men”; finally, “when I had cleared my selfe clearely, I stode halfe a quarter of an hower, and not a word came from the prests, in that if one of their folowers had not asked a question I beleve they would have gone away and not opened their mouths, but then they gott a litle up and…desputed about an hore [hour]. As for their asertions, if I had time to relat[e] them unto the[e], they would make the[e] mery, but in this, I shall forbear att present, but they went away with shame”; at Durham, “ we had a great meting and att Darnton [Darlington?], att Bowdan [possibly Great Burdon], Heighington, Shotten [Shotton], Carltion [Carlton] and Stockedan [Stockton-on-Tees]”; had a large general meeting at Gisbrough [Guisborough, in Yorkshire] to which came “many Freinds…of the woales [Wolds] 40 or 50 miles, and abundance of the world”; at Nothalerton [Northallerton] “we had a larg meting and at Richmond [in Yorkshire], and yesterday we had a metting at Houghton in the Spring [Houghton-le-Spring] within 4 miles of Darham [Durham]. it lay upon us to cume backe to itt agayne. The prest and people is falen out. Their was above a thousand people, and we had made such a sound in the cuntry with meting that the adversaries wheir sore greved and the comissioners had given order to breake the meting, and the asisses [assizes] being att Durham also, they sayd they wear a[f]rayd of sume insurection, and so their came a party of horse [and] wear declaring…[and] they stayed calmely and heard 5 or 6 hores [hours], and so we broke up the meting in peace and jpy”; Humphrey N[orton] “is come into this county [and] he was with John [Audland] and me att 3 metings, but spoke not, but only one day about 3 words. He is darke and subtill and bad, so att or near our parting, I spoke to him how I had receved ketters from beyond the sea and how [he] had done hurte and bad[e] him declared how things was if he was fre[e], so he tould us all or most of your pasiges their. We lett him se[e] his fol[l]y, but he is hard and bad…He sayd he wpuld be with us the last first day, but he was not but he went into Cleveland, we being come out of it. His enmity is greatt agaynst G.F. [George Fox]. He sayd thou was more moderate to him in the end then thou was att the first, as though thou had repented of wahtt thou had sayd to him, but he gathers things to keep up himself above judgment. I was att Anthony Pearson’s one night”; the latter had become wicked which is a pity for “there is a good thing in him” if only he “did keep out of the worlds spirite, for that betrayes him and hurts him. However, att present he is low and diligent at metings and beares a good strok[e] in the cuntry if he did but keep in god’s dominion. Heare is a greatt noyse in this cuntry of a rising, but as yet all is quiete, butt the prests hatcheth mischeife into peoples minds. There is 5,000 up in Lankishire [Lancashire] which ine [ Sir George] Bouth [Booth, first Baron Delmamere] and Coll[onel] [Gilbert?] Ireland heads by the instigation of the prests.

John Rouse’s letter of his travills etc [hand unidentified]

Contents:
Has by way of two letters “given my wife [Maragert, nee Fell, jr] an acc[oun]t of my service in my journey to Yorke [York], and that I had 8 meetings in 8 daies in my going thither”; feared it would be “a hard peice of service” and therefore desired a companion, “what could get none”, and soe “in faith in Him who had laid soe wieghty a service upon me, I went on and accomplished it to His praise and glorie”; came to Yorke “the evening before the Yearly meeting, and next day, after I had cleared my selfe among men Freinds, I had something upon me to… the women [and] among ym there was a very heavenly and blessed appearance of the Lord, it being taken notice of by some of the elder women that divers young women were getting into new fangled fashions concerning wch they spoake to severall who received their reproofe in love, and altered their dresse before they went out of towne”; on the first day, “there were two very large meetings,… one of men and the other of women, and they very much follow the method of the Yearly Meeting at London in calling over their severall monthly meetings and enquiring into all things that concerne Truth, and if there be any difficult case or difference between on Freind and another which cannot be easily determined, it is brought ot that meeting and persons most liekly are appointed to hear and determine such things. About the 6th hour in the morning the second day of the meeting, Freinds in the ministry had a meeting where were present about 30 yt have testimonies, where were many living testimonies,… and I having som[e]thing upon my spirit to propound to the meeting wch there was not time then to determine by reason the meetin[g] for busines had not finished wt they had to doe, and the great meeting for worship was to be that day, soe I desired Freinds to appoint another meeting, which they did next morning at the 5th hour. The generall meeting for worship was a very blessed and heavenly meeting, wherin neer 20 Freinds spoake an Freinds generally were very much comforted”; in fact, Friends thought “it was the best meeting they ever had”; the next morning, “when Freinds in the ministry were gathered together, I laid before them what was upon me, wch was to desire that there might be a setlment of that meeting, and that such as went forth to minister to others and had not a living testimonie, or were not in unitie with Freinds might be spoken to from yt meeting. If they would harken to Freinds it was well; if not, that Freinds, soe they have setled a meeting Freinds in the ministry every quarterly meeting and have put downe the anmes of severall that goe abroad and are not in unitie with Freinds and appointed severall to speake to them to come to the next meeting John Taylour [Taylor] and his wife [Frances nee Rither] are very servicable. John is very ready on all acc[oun]ts to serve the Truth… I was last 3d day at the Quarterly Meeting at Durham, wher[s] was a very good meeting, and having been at Darlington on First day I observed a great disorder in divers going out and in many times, and having taken notice of the like when I was here before at Durham and Stockton [on Tees], it lay upon me to lay it before the quarterly meeting and desired them that something might goe forth from them to ye monthly meetings and from ym to the particular meetings wherby such disorders and hurts to meetings might be prevented, wch divers Freinds were glad of, having been much burdened therwith, and after made an order accordingly, and when I had cleared myselfe at the Mens Meeting, I went to the Womens, where divers were going out and in disorderly as at other meetings, and would rise up and goe out of the meeting just as a Freind begane to speake”; could not be clear “without speaking ot them of it, and in lve layout before ym the disturbance and inconvenience that came thereby. Yesterday I came to this place [Sunderland] where a meeting is to be this day, and tomorrow I am to be at a meeting at Sheilds [probably North Shields], and on First day at Newcastle, and on 3d at Durham, and on 4th day at Bishop Aukland [Auckland], and on 6th day at Stockton [-on-Tees] and First day at Gisborough [Guisborough] in Cleaveland [Cleveland], and soe as the Lord makes way along the sea coast to Hull”; many Freinds have enquired “how thou dost, and [they] desire to have their dear love remembred to thee. I was very glad to hear by my wive’s letter that thou was something better as to thy health”; “My dear love to thee, my wife and children and Freinds”

Contents: [At the top of the letter, he notes that "for the Truth['s] sake, I desire this to be read in...the Quarterly Meeting, extending alsoe to ye Women's Assembly at Yorke"]; [this letter is badly damaged in the right hand margin]; "Haveing an exercise in my spirit concerneing some devisions wch hath happened of late touching the matter of marriage, which in it selfe [is perm?]mitted by God as a holy Ordinance and to be acted in true love,...wherefore I bese[e]ch you all who have a hand in that matter [to] let that love wch springs in ye true Light dwell in your hearts and this will lead into that mariage wch is honourable"; "The cause of some litle divission I suppose, is ye want of a true understanding of ye minde of one another and the brevity of some expressions in a testemony given forth for ye Truth['s] sakem and there is a travell in me that every soule be subject to that devine power wch gives ease,...wch alsoe inlarges ye hearte to doe those things wch ye world stumbles at...[and] that wch I finde is stumbled at is a limitation of time in mariage again by those wh[o] hath been maried formerly, wch I perceive has been occasioned by some hasty, forward mindes, wch though they profess ye Truth, yet ye Truth is not that wch girds up the loynes [loins] of their mindes, soe that a Godly care springs up in ye hearts of those who watches against errer,...and in a holy zeale as much as is possible, would stop ye foolish, irrigular, hasty Spirit, w[her]ever it appeares, least corrupt liberty should encrease instead of selfe denyeing spirittuallity. This I would have all understand...wch in hope, is ye ground of ye limita-tion in that Testim[ony] recorded, and that if causes weighty in ye Truth, or causes wch must by constraint, be admitted...be not pre[j]u[di]ced [?], we cannot but all in love and Truth agree that it is convenient and wholesome pr[actice to?] stay a yeare or more after ye decease of husband or wife,...and in this we are not of those that forbid mar[raige], but we are of those that exhort to a holy life, that holy mariages may be compleated in and amongst [the] people of God, and this further is in me to ease ye minde of every one that scruple, that we doe not lim[it] ye power and spirit of God in each perticular or monthly meeting, to binde them up to formes without life and power as to give noe admittance to any such wch may come before them though within ye yeare [after the death of a spouse[, bu[t] as in every meeting and monthly meeting, ye spirit, power and wisdome is not wanting, I hope, in measure to ju[dge] of ye causes that come before them, soe of necessiety not withstanding all lymiatation and Godly request be[fore] mentioned, it must be left to ye discerning of that devine power and Spirit of God in ye Brethren and sister[s] [of] every monthly meeting to search, examine and understand ye ground and cause of every mariage wch are br[ou]ght before them, not within ye yeare onely, but beyond ye yeare, not onely ye once maried, but ye never maried, seing a corrupt, hast[y] and disorderly intimation may be in ye one as well as in ye other, and in case [of] matters too hard for ye monthly meeting to determine at any season doe appeare, then to have recourse to ye quarterly meeting that unity may be preserved by a mutuall consent of ye whole body of Friends in ye county. Wherefore I beseech you,...let ye wisdome and power of God have ye rule and government...and let all who profess ye Truth keep their eye to that wch begetts them into it, wch is ye blessed true Light, and that will regulate their hearts and prune their mindes  into a true subjection of those things wch are decent in ye church, and where...any is overtaken with unholyness, too much hast and corrupt forwardness in these matters, the faithf[ull] [who?] keep their dwelling in ye Light, is to admonish such to help them out of ye snarre of ye enemy..."

Love to him and his wife [Anne] and to the rest of Friends “yt query after me”; received “thy letter yesterday and thou didst very well to give me and account, and I am sor[r]y that you have noe more help to assist concerning looking through the certificates and the sufferings to see ehat Fri[en]ds can be set at liberty [by means of the pardon given forth by james II], which have long laid in prison. I am sor[r]y that Fri[en]ds should be backward or wanting in soe good a work, and if any be out of ye way, you must speak to some others to draw up a list of every county that can be set at liberty by a warrant, but if you can get ye King’s [James II’s] warrant suddenly, yt will reach more of them, then they may come out together. And if you could have gott into ye warrant them that lye upon contempts and not swearing to their answers and otherwise, and as I take it many lye upon capass [capias writs] for not paying tyth[e]s, a way of contempt, and if Fri[en]ds come out upon fines for meeting, I think there is a matter of 20 will come out at Lancaster wch were fined by [Sir George] Gefferyes [Jeffreys] £20 a peece, and if thee seest W[illiam] Pen [Penn] and Rob[ert] Barkley [Barclay] I gave them a letter concerning swearing [for] w[he]n R.B.

And theirupon you may remember that before I put forth my book intitulled, De Ch[ristiana] Lib[ertate [,or, Liberty of Conscience; Wing B5370], I wrot[e] to you, not for your sake, or that I ever owned you to have any such power confer[e]d upon you or delegated to you above the rest of your Bretheren,....but for ye people['s] sake, whoe, many of them mean well, allthough zealous for ye traditions of ye elders, least sufferings should be augmented to them throw [through] these publick p[ro]ceedings...signifieing that if you (who assumed to yourselves ye sole power in ecclesiasticall things amongst the people caled Quakers, as is evedently demonstrated by your lycenceing, abredging or condemning and altering ehat is to be printed, and by your Epistles directory to our Quarterly and monthly meeteing sometimes to send up our sufferings to London, sometimes to send up the names of those ministers who first preached the Gospell in the dispensation of Light amongst us and the names of such who first received them, that soe I conceive they may be cannonized together, and sometimes for a gen[er]all collection throwout England and Wales (and the territories therunto belonging) for ye service of Truth, as you pretend, and sometimes to advice us to get a Statute Book to e[a]ch Quarterly Meeteing, and sometimes to send up the names of our p[er]se[c]uters and what judgments of God have befall[e]n them, that soe, I suppose you may be ye better inabled how to set forth to posterity a heape of marracles [miracles] thereby undermineing the reputeations of all P[ro]testant churches, and you only, for time to come, to be accounted the only true, infallable and unerring Catholick church that the gates of Hell can[n]ot prevaile ag[ain]st, and sometimes for e[a]ch Quarterly meeteing to send up twoe chosen men to the Yearly meeteing, that as our representatives they may act, etc.).

Addressed:
Endorsed: G.F.'s answer to John Story's Letter, 10th, 10 m., 78 [hand unidentified]
Contents: [This appears to be a rough draft of the letter]-Recently received a paper "with thy name att itt, where thou seems to cover thy selfe with some sensorious expreessions in it, which does not touch mee, but this will not doe thy business"; "Ye sayst thou cannot but much wonder not only at thy want of charity but confidence in declareing yt I have forged ye reports ag[ain]st my selfe and others signified in ye little pap[er] from Hartford [Hertford]...or yt I have some to forge ym for me,...and then thou passest sentence and saith I was not guided by ye Spirit of God in these things, nor is it any evidence to thy conscience etc. Jo[h]n, thou hast wronged my words, for my words was, that thou hadst either forged ym thy selfe or some others for thee, for they were things yt I never heard of before, and as for thy saying I wanted charity, thou might have kept yt at home, and for thy sensorious judgem[en]t I matter itt not of judgeing my spirit,...but I say againe those things was forged,...and if they write never so many certificates to justifie it, then they justifie false things,...and y[o]u sayst y[o]u never heard of any coppy of yt pap[er] from Harford till of late, and yet Samuell Watsen [Watson] had it in harvest, and why was it shewed to him. Was hee concerned? And was it not first shewed to him without a name and because it was questioned who was ye author, and then of another market day was it not brought to him w[i]th a name hard to be knowne who it was, and neither towne nor countrey or time when and is not this want of charity, or is this ye spirit of God? And thou confessest it was enclosed to a Freind in Barkshire [Berkshire], but what Fr[ien]d and who sent it, y[o]u hast not named, and I say it had been most proper...for thee or Hen[ry] Sweeting or yt Fr[ien]d in Barksh[i]re 1st to have sent to mee, for I am not a man soe hidden. I might easily have been found out, but I question whether I should have heard any thing but by others of this Spirit's work"; also "y[o]u sayst y[o]u has neither been ye author nor spreader of these things further yn...shewed ye enclosed [not with the letter] to some of ym reproached etc. Didst not yu shew it to widdow Wharton soon after it came to thy hand, and is she one of your sep[ar]ate company? If not, how dost thy words hang together in Truth"; also whereas "y[o]u sayst yt wch y[o]u spoake of mee at Sedburgh [Sedbergh]...it was about my false sight of J.W. [John Wilkinson] and thee, that yee were dead inwardly, and in thy envy calls this imaginnation and discovers my weakness etc. Nay Jo[h]n, this [is] neither weakness nor imagination nor false sight, but it is...true, your fruits has declared it and it will be bitter to you in ye end"; the Lord "knowes my tenderness to you when you were att Swarthmore yt you might break up your Sep[ar]ate meeting and come to ye witness of God,...and as for thy saying wh[e]n yu wast at Swarthmore it was my weakness, I never heard of yt before [and] if I had, I should have answered itt"; "I look upon thee and Jo[h]n W[ilkinson] to be my fellow servants in Christ in ye state ye stand, and it had been well if you had kept in your estate as when you were 1st convinced,...then there had been none of this strife and jangling with your neighbours and others. And yu sayest thou knows of noe narrative spread of ye 3 meetings at Bristoll [Bristol] when I and Will [probably referring to William Penn, although William Gibson was also present at those meetings; see Braithwaite, Second Period, pp. 314-315] and others was there...This is very strange John yt thou should not see itt. Did not W[illia]m Chambers shew it to Sam[uel] Watson in Yorkshire? How came he to it and who brought it downe contrary to agreem[en]t...on both sides yt no papers should goe forth without sight and consent on both partys"; also "y[o]u...make thy selfe as ingnorant of another paper shewed to some of Sedber [Sedbergh] meeting with W[illia]m R[oger]s' name subscribed to it, full of envyous callumnyes and slanders ag[ains]t mee"; likewise, "y[o]u hast said twice thou hast not spread abroad nor shewed yt pap[er] from Hartford saving to ym yt was reproached etc. Then if y[o]u didst but shew it to them, how come W.C. to have a coppy of it?"; also "thou sayst twice in thy pap[er] that y[o]u signified under hand to mee of ye falseness of yt which Israell Noise [Noyse's] wife and Marmaduke did testifie under their owne hands w[ha]t y[o]u said of mee,...but I cannot beleive those people to be forgers of lyes agt thee,...But Jo[h]n, under whose hand was it thou signified to mee? Was thy owne hand at it, for I se[e] noe hand att itt, and I told them thou would deny it, and Israell Noise wife and Mar[ma]duke said if yu didst deny it, they would witnesse it to thy face, to witt, that I had been a preacher in Lancashire among ye Ranters and lived amonge ym there before I came into Westmerland [Westmorland], and there was some trembling amongst ym, some true and some false, and from that was called Quakers, and thou tells me a story of Gervis [Gervase] Benson and Tho[mas] Tayler [Taylor],...wch I know noe thing of"; also, "y[o]u tells of Israell Noise wife telling T.T. [Thomas Taylor] a lye which he might have spread abroad for Truth, wch touched thy selfe. Therefore thou took them face to face and stopt it, wch I know nothing of"; can produce "a certifiecate lately rec[eive]d from Israell Noise wife and Mar[ma]duke of the truth of those things thou saidst unto ym which they stand too...And Jo. Brown's wife's words I doe relate as she spoak them before us word for word and what was said to thee at London, yt is nothing to ye purpose. It clears not ye matter, neither did she say it was 200 miles as y[o]u sayst, but 100 miles of[f] yt yu didst say yu took God to witness yu had noe hand in ye Sep[ar]ate meeting, for y[o]u was 100 miles of[f] as she said twice over. If this be true, thy neighbours whom you have sep[ar]atedd from knowes best, and how canst thee say it's a stigmatizing to call you a Sep[ar]ate Meeting...Freinds and ye world sees it and takes notice of it, and if you hadst noe hand neither in setting up ye Sep[ar]ate meeting nor manageing any of their affaires, yn why dost yu set thy hand to ye pap[er] of prescriptions, conditions and articles?"; "Was there noe Sep[ar]ate meetings before yt pap[er] was given forth, and before yt marryage thou speaks of, laying it before ye womens meeting, and did noe body come to admonish ym and to know ye reason wherefore you sep[ar]ated, before your prescriptions of articles came forth?"; "How couldst yu be an 100 miles of[f] when yu put thy name to ye pap[er] of prescriptions of articles, and was it not a pitifull thing to make a sep[ar]ation because a couple would not goe to ye womens meeting as yu sayst that was ye ground as yu art informed? And yu would make us beleive yt yu art very ignorant of ye actions of ye Seperate meeting and will not Jo[hn] Wilkinson say ye same, yet are they not your society?"; it is no use "thy talking of Truth as was in ye begining"; they must repent; could speak of many things "in thy large, blotted pap[er], wch in some place[s] can hardly be read, but they are not worth taking notice of"; deisres "yt thee and you all...may come to ye holy Spirit of God and judge downe all yt strife yt has gott[en] up"; "But upon some considerations I had sent thee thy letter back againe without answering any thing to itt"; (postscript- "And as for thy sending my denyall to Harford [Hertford], that thou speaks of, thou may spair thy labour, for I have sent thither myselfe")

And whereas thou said and thought yt I or others went to cover others and to condemne thee, these thoughts and yt sayinge thou must judge alsoe with ye Sp[iri]t of God"; and whereas "there has beene severall words on both sydes, and they say thou said soe and soe, and thou says thou said not soe and soe, lett all those words with ye Sp[iri]t of God bee putt downe and in it forgive one another where there has been matter of difference and strife about words amongst you, but ye other things before is a matter of fact relateinge to ye order of ye Church wch thou must judge"; (postscript- "And thou should not have gone away with prejudice, for in yt thou didst not well, Thou must take heed of yt, for it was a wrong thing in thee, so thou must come over yt")

: M[emoran]d[um], that Sam[uel] Cater be writ to that An[n] Docwra reports she believes Giles Barn[ardi]st[on] paid S[amuel] Cater ye money, I think, £10, because he said he would (to her), who dyed soon after, and that Briget [Bridget] Litchworth [Letchworth] (that was), was big bellyed before marriage, and is of Ye Woman[s] Meeting, not censured, as F.B. [Francis Bugg] told her [hand unidentified]
Contents: The following is "a few words in p[ur]sute of a Scandollous booke put forth by George Whitehead called Judgment Fixed [Wing W1937]...ag[ain]st myself [Francis Bugg] and others, shewing some reasons why I p[ro]secuted Sam[ue]ll Cater about a fine I sufferred throw his consealling his name and habitation [for more on this episode, see Bugg's The Painted Harlot both Stript and Whipt, pp. 73 ff.; Wing B5380, and Cater's The Liberty of an Apostate Conscience Discovered; Wing C1486; see also numbers 221, 224, and 224a],...wch may serve untill...I have leaisrue to be more large in answere to that and other things beeing at any time ready to give any neighbore satisfaction in any p[ar]ticular on the poynt in controv[er]sy"; in 1675, "I suffered a fine of £15 for being present in a meeteing at Lakenheath where Sam[ue]ll Cater preached, by reason he did not tell his name and habitation, as by ye records of conviction and Justice's warr[an]t I can make appear etc., and judging it but reasonable that Sam[ue]ll being of late growne a rich man should bear his own burthen, since I sufferred my owne fine for beeing at ye same meeteing besides. [I] told him my mind privately and w[he]n he was contrary minded to mee herein, saying he would not give a gr[o]at, adding that if he should, then all that was fined, as I was, might come upon our Friends in the ministry, or to this effect etc. Whereupon I p[er]ceived it was a designe upon the people tending to slavery and bondage, and thereupon I was resolved to p[ro]secute the matter, and soe I did from Yearly Meeteing to Monthly, and from Month[ly] Meeteing to Quarterly and from Quarterly Meeteing to Yearly Meeteing againe and againe over and over for a heareing by p[er]sons indifferently elected by us both in order to try whether I had right to ye restitution of ye s[ai]d fine, but over governing p[ar]ty finding where the shoe pinched and w[ha]t might in all p[ro]babillity...be ye consequences of such a debate, stiffly denyed it for some years, but at length I obtained it, and arbitrators by Sam[ue]ll and myself was chosen, a day set and a place mutually appoynted, e[a]ch of us bound in a bond of £30 to e[a]ch other to stand to there award, but soe it fell out that the arbitrators could not agree as to poynt of right and soe p[ar]ted"; however, soon after "Sam[ue]ll's wife [Elizabeth] sent my cousin Geo[rge] Smith of Litleport [Littleport] to my house to agree to the matter, who 1st p[ro]-fferred ne £5 (as Sam[uel] Cater on ye day yt our arbitrators debated ye matter p[ro]ffered me himselfe). I told him that would not doe, soe then he p[ro]fferred me £7, 10s. I told him likewise that would not doe, but if I ended the matter with him, the wholl should be tendered, and when done I should make it appear that my end was not only for money. Soe he at at that time refused such a tender, but desired to know when he might see mee againe. I told him that I was to bee at Ely Faire, soe thither he came and againe p[ro]ffered me £7, 10s.= after about 3 weeks deliberate consideration, but I told him as before that if I ended the matter with him, the wholl should bee tendered, so he tendered ye w[ho]ll[e] £15. Then I gave him a discharge for Sam[ue]ll Cater in full of ye s[ai]d fine, charges in p[ro]secution and interest and all damages sustained thereby, and w[he]n this was done, then I likewise gave him a paper like yt mentioned in ye booke cald Judgment Fixed, p.210, shewing that if Samuell would signe it, I would return ye said £15 to shew that my end was not only for mony, but most principally for ye priveledge of the hearers who had bene long oppressed by their selfe saveing and others oppressing principle, viz. not to declar[e] y[ou]r n[ame] and hab[itation] unless demanded by the magistrates, wch in all likelyhood was not to bee untill the magistrates became informers, and this I have often told them that I was as willing to doe as the com[m]ons of England was to give King Hen[ry] ye 3d the 15th p[ar]te of their moveables for Magna Charta etc. See 9 Hen. 3 and confirmed ye 28 Edw. 2, and this said pap[er] wch is su[ch] and equall p[ro]position viz, either to tell y[ou]r n[ame] and hab[itation] or reimburst such as suffer fro[m] ym,...G.W. [George Whitehead] in p[p/] 210, 211, call[s] a 'rule', a 'cannon', an 'edict' etc. But Geo[rge] Whitehead forgot, or else thought it not for his purpose to...recite the order that was made to be observed in suffering times by himselfe and others of the preachers and leaders at a Yearly Meeteing in London, ye 27 day of May, anno 1675 viz., NOT TO DECLINE, FORSAKE NOR REMOVE OUR MEETINGS IN TIME OF SUFFERINGS, LIKE WORLDLY, FEARFULL AND POLLITICK PROFESSORS ETC. [capitals are those of Bugg.] This I am sure was a 'rule', a 'cannon' and a 'presc[r]iption', wherein noe liberty is given, ney, not to 'decline, forsake or remove'. Here was dictators, prescr[i]bers, and arbitrary or infallable law makers etc., wch of itselfe is a reason sufficient capasity, or else to what purpose did they give forth this 'cannon', this 'rule', this 'edict', that wee must not in suffering times forsake, nor remove, ney not soe much as decline meeteing...if our preachers who make this law and give forth this directory, like a company of cowards refuse to stand with us in a like suffering capasity, as that they doe...untill they declare their n[ame] and hab[itation], but wee must suffer for them and ourselves too. But G.W. [George Whitehead] say[s] I am more arbitrary in my p[ro]posalls then the Conventicle Act [22 Car.2, cap.1] for that Act say[s] this skilfull George, doe[s] not require ye preacher to declare his n[ame] and habitation,...but let me tell him that the Conventicle Act...doe[s] noe where injoyne us to meete and not to forsak[e], decline nor remove our meeteings, but I am sure it enjoyne[s] the contrary. But as for Georg[e] Whitehead, Stephen Crisp, Will[ia]m Pen [Penn] and many more of our preaches in there recited 'cannon, edict or directory' to be observed in suffering times, and therefore the more shame for them if w[he]n sufferings come they shall draw the[i]r necks out of ye coller and neith[e]r declar[e] yr n[ame] and hab[itation] nor...reimburst such as suffer for them, insoemuch as yt in the loss of £13,500, the ministry have not suffered ye loss of £50 w[he]r[e] straing[e]rs, and yet gre[a]t p[ar]te of it suffer[e]d for ye unknowne preachers; yea unknowne indeed. And this I can make apear by...5 booke[s] putt fo[r]th to King and Parl[i]am[en]te to shew our sufferings wch great oppression began to ex[c]eed that of tythes wee have soe longe witnessed ag[ain]st etc. But suppose I had got £15 of G[eorge] Smith that I had noe right too, as Geo[rge] Whitehead falsely insinuate[s], yet to publish ye same by print...before it hath bene tryed in a court of judicature is illegall and without a presdent [precedent] eith[e]r in ye law of God or ye law of ye land, but if ye Com[m]on Law would not right him, then his way had bene to exhibbet a bill in Chancery ag[ain]st me, whereby I had bene compellable to set forth my tythe thereunto, but to print before tryall their thoughts, apprehentio[n]s and constructions is abominabl[e], and should all men take...yr [their] rule for an example, what work here would be in England? But ye law of charity forbid[s] it. This I thought fit to send in p[ur]sute aft[e]r ye s[ai]d book, and soe rest their traduced and grosely abused Fr[ien]d"

: [A note appended by Joshua Bangs] - Notes that this paper was "given to Tho[mas] Bradbury of Mildenhall, steward to H.N. [Henry North] to whom F.B. [Francis Bugg] dedocayed his book [De Christiana Libertate, or, Liberty of Conscience; Wing B5370]...and T.B. at my request gave it to mee. F.B. and I having some discourse, hee said yt publishing things of ye nature of S.C.'s [Samuel Cater's] narrative [The Liberty of an Apostate Conscience Discovered; Wing C1486] could bee of no service, wth his many reason[s] etc. My answere was that in my judgm[en]t, it would bee of good service to some yt might have read his book put forth...[De] Christ[iana] Lib[ertate], for by reading yt narrative or things of yt nature, they might be satisffied hee was no conscientous man yt could do such things as hee have done, so reject him and his book too. If Fr[ien]ds think fitt, something in answere hereunto may bee put in ye end of S[amuel] Cater's narative"
: [The following is a note appended by Samuell Cater for George Whitehead]; he and J.B. [Joshua Bangs] thought it convenient "to sind [send] the[e] this that thou maye doe with it as thou fines fredo[m] in thy selfe. As to what he sayeth about his f[i]rst speaking to me about the fien [fine] and of my ancer [answer] at that time, [it] is falc [false] as doth plainly apeare by my narative...which I desiare J[ohn] Bringhurst wou[l]d heast[e]n to sind doun, for now the[i]r is an exp[ec]tachion in peopels minds of it, by what this bookes speaks of it. We have rec[eive]d the books J.B. sint to E. Firth. Joshua [Bangs], his deare love is to the[e]. He is very sarvisabel [servicable] and teakes [takes] pains to find out F.B.'s desait [deceit] and to manefist [manifest] it.

John Rouse’s letter to G.F. from Marsh Grange, 12, 1st, 87/8, R[ichard] Richadrson may read this in the morning meeting [hand unidentified] 
Contents: 
“ While thou was at Kingston [upon Thames, Surrey], I doe not question but my wife [Margaret nee Fell] gave thee an acc[oun]t of my travels, I writing to her every weeke, and this is to aquaint thee of our travels since, Leonard Fell being much taken up about the lease land, and an expectation of buying corne for severall at London, he could not goe with me as I expected, soe Joseph Nicholson and I went to Sedber [Sedbergh] meeting the 22 of the 11th mo[n]th [January], wch was a very large and ful meeting, and met Tho[mas] Robbinson [Robinson] there, and at night we parted and had two very good evening meetings where many people of the world were, and ye 23d we had a very good meeting at Grayrigge [Grayrigg], and the 24th at kendall [Kendal] where was James Moore and another of the seperates [separatists] with w[ho]m I had a great deale of discours[e] after meeting but they are hardened in opposition to Truth. On ye 25th day we had a meeting at Camesgill [Camsgill] and on the 26th day we returned to Swarthmore, and in the 28th day we went to Hauxside [Hawkshead], and on the 29th had a very large…meeting there, and on ye first of the 12th mo[n]th [February] we had a meeting at Keswick and on the 2d day at Pardsay [Pardshaw] Cragge [Crag] and on the 3d day, a day meeting at West End and in the evening a very large meeting at Whitehaven [in Cumberland] where were abundance of people of the world”; would have been a good and servicable meeting “had not some rude seamen made a disturbance”; on the fifth day there was “a very large meeting at Pardsey [Pardshaw] Cragge [Crag] and…an evening meeting at Cockermouth, and on 7th day…a large evening meeting at Broughtin, and ye 8th at Holme [in Cumberland], and on the 9th day…a very large…meeting at Murris [Moorhouse, in Cumberland] neer the widdow Stordie’s [probably the widow of Thomas Stordy] and from thence we went to Carlile [Carlisle] and soe to Newcastle where we met with John Bowren [Bowron], John Langhorne and Robert Wardall [Wardell] and John Carlike [Carlile] and John Bowsted] Bowstead] went wth us and in the 12th day had two very large…meetings there, and the 13th was their monthly meeting where a long difference among the glasse makers was referred to Freinds that were strangers, wch was made an end of after neer two daies spent in hearing all parties”; on the 14th, “Joseph and John Bowsed [Bowstead] went to a meeting at Shields [this could be either North Shields, in Northumberland, or South Shields, in Durham opposite to North Shields], while I with some other Freinds stayed to make an end of the difference. On the 15th we had an evening meeting at Sunderland and on the 16th at Durham and on the 17th we came to the Monthly Meeting at Stockton [on Tees, in Durham] where we heard the whole proceedings of Freinds with Richard Watson and a paper was read wch he sent to ye meeting to condemne he [his] extravagancie in trade, and breaking [i.e. going bankrupt], wch seemed a fine, smooth thing at the first reading of it, but w[he]n Freinds came to inspect narrowly into it, they found it much short of clearing the reproach he had brought upon Truth, and soe it was returned [to] him again. I find Freinds in those parts have had a very great respect for him and have yet, many of them,…beyond his deserts, for divers of them are yet apt to speake very favourably of him, but by reason of the influence he had upon many, he hath made a great sporte among many poor Freinds, for if he knew of any that had mony he got it from them, and among the rest he got £50 from my sister [Isabel] Yeamans, and he bought the house he lives in of[f] [a] young mman yt was an apprentice and gave him £5 in hand and his bond and judgment to pay him £200 when he was out of his time, wch the young man depended on as a stock to set up with, but now he is out of his time, [he] is quite at a losse, and Richard hath morgaged the house to another man for mony borrowed of him. I hear the weeke before he broake, he was at Durham and spoake after he came home very much of the service he had there, but when the news came to Durham of his being broake, people very much reflected upon Freinds and soe farre as I hear Edw[ard] Haistwell and Nath[aniel] Wilmer are like to loose a great deale by him. We there again met with John Bowren [Bowron], John Langstaffe and Rob[er]t Wardall [Wardell], and Rob[er]t Lodge came thither the day before, [and] on the 19th we had two large meetings there, and on the 21st we had a very large meeting at Gisborough [Guisborough] in Cleaveland [Cleveland] where was the Lady Chaloner and three of her sisters and many more people of the world,…and on the 22d I went to see Will[ia]m Pen’s [Penn’s] sister [Margaret] and her husband [Anthony Lowther] who were both wel[l] and very loving, and at night we had a very large meeting at Whitbey [Whitby], and on the 23d at Scarborough, and on the 24th, as we were going to Burlington [Bridlington] we met James Dickenson [Dickinson] who had been there and was going to Scarborough. At Burlington we had a large meeting in the evening, where were diverse Presbiterians who were very much affected and earnestly desired our stay on first day, and Freinds being very earnest with us, though we had intended for York, we stayed and on the 25thday had an evening meeting at Burlington [Bridlington] Key [Quay] where were many professours, and on the 26th, being first day, wee had two very large meetings where were many professors and other people of the world”; on the 27th, “we came to Yorke [York] and had a large meeting there in ye 28th day, where I got a very grevious cold that hath made me very hoarse every [ever] since, and on the 3d instant [i.e. of the 1st month] we came to Swarthmore where we founf them all very well, and Freinds are very diligent in providing materials to build the meeting house. Next 6th day, come a weeke, Joseph [Nicholson] and I thinke to have a meeting at yealand [in Lancashire], and in first day after at Lancaster and soe thinke to passe southward visiting Freinds”; would like this account shown to “my brother and sister [probably William and Sarah Meade]”; love “to thee, my brother [William] and sister [Sarah nee Fell] Meade, Ben[jamin] Antrobus and his wife [Mary nee Burrall]”; (Postscript- “Many Freinds where we came inquired after thee, to w[ho]m I remembered thy dear love, and they desired to have their dear love remembered to thee. If thou please, let Grace Watson know we were at Staneforth [Stainfoth, in Yorkshire] and her father [Samuel] and mother [Mary nee Monk] and sisters [Mercy and Peace were her full sisters, while Mary and Elizabeth were her half-sisters] were all pretty well, only her mother is something crazy. My brother [Thomas] and sister [Mary nee Fell] Lower are well with their children [Loveday, Margery and Richard] and remember their dear love to thee. He hath rec[eive]d thy letter, but cannot as yet answer it for want of having the acc[oun]t from Swarthmore wch wilbe as soon as possible may be”)

Research Notes: NNR 10/2023: 
It looks as if there is an error in the correction/ clarification made by Horle in this letter because it is saying that Margaret Fell is John Rous's wife in the beginning where her name is in brackets, but I believe the intention was to say to George Fox that his wife was updating him (John Rous) on his happenings and whearabouts.

Just as it had been “in my heart to aquaint thee when I was under som[e] exercise in relation to my reuturn, and also give thee…an account that the Lord hath bin good unto me and mine”; whereas “I receaved then from thee som[e] lines expressing thy judgm[en]t and advice wch tended to my freedom, but wtf som[e] cautions, as to be upon a sure ground signifying my service, and my being so well beloved in my countrey,…I kept these sayings in my heart”; [goes on at some length to praise the Lord]; “I cam[e] [to England] simply upon Truth’s account w[i]thout limitation of time in relation to my return, I mean before I find my way cleer, and left a tender wife and a considerable family of children and servants well settled and ordered, considering the time, in a good neighbourhood [Ellis had settled among Welsh Friends, west of the Schuykill river, in Philadelphia; see The Friend , vol. 27 (1854), p. 188]. Ab[ou]t 15 families of us have taken our land together and are to be ab[ou]t 8 more that have not yet com[e]. We tooke (to begin) 30 accres a piece, wch we built upon and doe improve, and the other land we have for range to our cattell. We have our burying place where we intend our meeting house as neer as we can to the center. Our First day and week dayes meetings well observed, beside oue mens and womens meetings, and anohter monthly meeting, both in week dayes, unto wch four townshipps at least belongs”; although “ I cam[e] but thus farr, I am given to understand that as it may fall out, that som[e], if not many, may be overforward in letting out the mind to goe to forreigne parts, or to promise themselves more then either reason or wisdom could expect, so likewise on the other hand, there is an extream savouring of…a prejudice ag[ain]st either p[er]sons or countrey or both, and so much thwarting on[e] ag[ain]st anohter that the path is narrow that leads between, but pleasant and peaceable to ym yt walk therin. I wish those that have estates of their own, and to leave fullnes to their posterity, may not be offended at the Lord’s opening a door of mercy to thousands in England, especially in Wales and other nations, who had no estates, either for themselves or children, and that all their industry could not afford them the meanest food and raym[en]t that might properly be sayd to belong even to slaves or servants, nor any visible ground of hope for a better condic[i]on for children or children’s children when they were gon[e] hence. I desire the God of my life…may preserve His from having a hand crucifying the inocent between two evill doers, that in the…unity of the spirit we may all wittnes our being bound to that peace and good behaviour that whether in prosperity or adversity we may all be found together, whether in duffering or otherwise it may be. I may not at this time particularize the cause of these last expressions, but…it is in the subjection to that wch I write to, even the spirit of true judgm[en]t in thee that if thou find anything amiss, let it be as if it never had bin written, ex[c]epting my portion whether by councill or reproofe. I cam[e] fro[m] home since the 12 mo. [February] intending to be at the Yearly Meeting but could not have any shipping for 6 weekes, being there was such winter weather, the like was hardly known, and do no seasoning we[a]ther for their tobacco, and a sore visitation in Mariland [Maryland], in so much that many hundreds dyed there in this last fall and winter”; these included all sorts of people, including “3 or 4 doctors on the Easter[n] Shore, while I was there”, and also including Thomas Taylor and his wife [Elixabeth?], Bryan Mele [Omelia], Thomas Furby, “and many other servicable Friends, by a violent feaver, but it seemed to be well over before I cam[e] thence. I suppose you have had an account of Pensilvania [Pennsylvania] affaires by New York as was intended at the Monthly Meeting at Philadelphia. The President was not then at home, but was expected from New York.Som[e] young people continues to com[e] over w[i]thout certificates wch is a toruble to Friends. I am like to continue in Wales a while, where I would be glad to meet wth W[illia]m Bingley or such”; (Postscript- would be glad “to have a few lines fro[m] W[illia]m Bingley being I know not how to direct to him, or where he is. I have sent a few lines for W.P. [William Penn?]. I know not whether he may have it; if not and this com[e] to thee, let him have part of it, and glad would I hear fro[m] him, the least especially if mine to him miscaried. It is dated here ab[ou]t 4 dayes ago. If any letter com[e] for me, I may have it by Penbrokeshire [Pembrokeshire] directed to Peregrine Musgrave, clothier, in Haverford West in Penbrokeshire, South Wales, for Thomas Ellis. John Burnyeat wrote to thee lately; his and his wife’s [Elizabeth nee Maine] love is to thee”)

Ye men sayd I should. I sayd, ‘It is written in this warrant yt I may bee brought beefore you to answer ye premisses. Heare mee speake. What I heard this my accuser say in ye steeplehouse I shall declare and what words I spoke in exhortation to him and ye people and judge wth yt wch is just in you whether my words was good words or evill words to prove a disturbance. Hee sayd wee are a people who turne ye grace of God into wantones. Therefore are these horrid secteries lett loose uppon us as a greate judgment of God. I sayd’yee who have turned ye grace of God into wantones doe soe noe more’. This was in ye forenoone spoken. As for ye words hee my accuser hath sworne to yt I sayd, ‘hold thy peace’, they was not spoken by mee, but Tho[mas] Rookby, ye preist cryed to mee,’sarra, sarra, hold your peace’”; the justices said little but the priest [Thomas Rookby] said, “’I will passe by ye forenoone and prove you disturbed mee the af[ter]noone when I was cate kiseinge [catechizing]’. Sayd one of ye justices, “Then you was askinge questions?’ I sayd, ‘Questions beeinge given out, answers are to bee given to them [qu]estions’. I asked him… where his witnes was and who those horrid sectories was. Did hee call ye present powre wch was one wth justice and true judgment a sect, or horrid sectaries wch hee spoke of in ye forenoone? Ye preist sayd, ‘Would thou have mee to call ye Parliment sectories? I doe not call thee a sectorie’. ‘Come’, sayd one of ye justi[c]es “Mr. Rookby, bringe your wittnesses and lett us heare what they can say’. I sayd, ‘ I require justice of you and yt ye witnesses and ye preist may not stand together least ye witnesses gather words from him, for they are pore men and hee rules over them and lett ye wittnesses bee examined one by one asunder one from another and let it bee written downe for here is many of them and lett their testimonie bee taken and yee shall see they will speake contrary one to another, and if they doe not, yee shall say I am a lyinge spirit’. Soe they went to examination and ye wittnesses [wa]s confounded and ran on in generall words, the Lawyer sayinge I spoke two [wor]ds for one yt ye minister spoke in ye church and made a disturban[c]e”; however the lawyer was unable to say “what words I spoke”; two others were examined about the words, “but could not say what words I spoke,…soe ye justices gave over examination of ye witnesses and ye Hirelinge [i.e. the priest Thomas Rookby] fled wth his followers, and one Claton [John Clayton], called a Justice, sayd, ‘Tho[mas], you are proved a distruber of minusters, but Mester Rookby is willing to forgive you this fa[u]lt if…you would disturbe him noe more but if you disturbe him againe, you must bee sent to Yorke gaole or become bound to good beehavious’. I sayd, “John Claton, I am bound all readie by yt wch is stronger then hand writings and I am here, doe wth mee what you have powre to doe, but they sayd, ‘Tho[mas], goe your way from amonghst us’, soe they separate[d] mee out of their company, out of ye hall where they satt mee, and my wife [Mary] wth mee. The preist doth yet boast hee hath gotten another warrant for to take mee if…I come to disturbe him againe”; however, “it ley uppon me yt I should try his spirit and ye magistrates spirits, for I felt yt Act [The Lord’s Day Act, 1656, cap.15] of 6 months prisonment or payment of five pounds to bee layd uppon him wch diturbed a minister, to bee a bond over ye Lorde wch I was to breake thorow [through]…It was soe wth mee yt I did speake to him and ye people what my God gave mee to speake, in ye forenoone when hee was in his sermon, as it is called, and in his time of caticizinge in ye afternoone of one first day about 3 weekes agoe.

A Letter of Salutation to E.B. and F.H. from Bristoll [hand unidentified]

Contents:

[The first part of this letter is written by John Camm]-
Every day at their table “we feede with you upon the bread of life and we drinke with you of the eternall fourtaine of life and we ly[e] downe with you the armes of our Father’s love, and we rejoyse with you to doe our Father’s will and we laber dayly with you in the vin[e]yard of our Father”; the fields there abouts are “allready ripe unto harvest and… truly our labor is great”; there are “the largest feilds yt ever I saw; all is full of clusters of grapes and they ar[e] ripe for the winepresse”; the previous day, “we weare… 3 milles out of the towne [at Bishport] whear we had a gallant meeteing, above five hundereth peopll as they weare nomber[e]d, and truly they weare very pre[t]ty peopll as ever I saw since I cam[e] out of the north”; day and night “we labor and trevell; we wat[c]h and feed and pluckes up and weeds up som[e]times waters the plants though they be but few as yet”; “0 deare bredern, pray for us yt we may be keept in wisdom, in corrage, in bouldnes and in desserneing”; that day “the peopll in this city [Bristol], who are our Frinds [probably referring to the large number of ‘Seekers’ in Bristol] met together to seekes the Lord, as they call it. Ther[e] wase many with the gloryousest words in prayer that ever I herd. Ther[e] was the trimed harrlott glorously dectt, and we wear by and hard them and… we went unto them and we boor them long till the power of the Lord to[o]k hould upon us both and I [John Camm] was forst to cry out amongst them. My life suffered and if I did not speak I should be an exampell amongst them, and in much tendernes I spocke unto them and sillence was amongst them all”; however “ther[e] are much wisdom wch is from below in them, but it is truly confounded, and they se[e] it their enemye, and now begines to desir[e] yt they wear foules, for now they are com[e] to se[e] the serpent wch hath beguiled them and robed htem of the[i]r simplisity, they have manye of them, cast of[]f the[i]r butyfull garrments, wch was without, but now the butyfull garrments within is seen, the mistery of witchcraft is now mad[e] manyfest to them to be in them and now the[i]er juells [jewels] of silver and gould they are casting to the moules and to the bats, and shame doth cover the[i]r faces, for now they see themselfes naked. Ther[e] is a puer simplisity in them yt would forgoe all for the Truth”; cannot express “our labor and care and travell, for we travell in paine unto [untill] Christ be formed in them and we ar[e] with them in frear and trembeling lest the[i]r faith should stand in wisdom of words and not in the power of God, for we ar[e] with them from 6 in the morning, they will com[e] to us befor[e] we get up, and unto 11 or som[e]time one at night; thye will never be from us; goe into the feilds they will follow us or goe into any house, the house will be fill[e]d full, so that we cannot tell how we should get from them. The Lord hath subjected then all under us and they ar[e] as fearefull to of[f]end us as a child is to offend its loveing father”;
(postcript to this part of the letter- love to Dorothy Dringe [Dring] and to “all in yt house”, and also to Cap[tain] [Amor] Studard [Stoddard], “to Simound, to [the] Barber and… to Meary [Mary] Errbery [Erbury] and her daughter [and] to all the rest. We hav[e] received the letters we wanted [probably from Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough in London]. They are found and we are very glad”; love from Friends there);
[The next part of the letter is wrriten by John Audland]-
Have never been in such service, labouring night and day and travelling continuously; came into the city [Bristol] “upon the 7 day [Thursday] of this mounth [September] [and] that night it was noysed in the citty and all was filled wheare we weare”; had a meeting “every day…; yea I may say every day is but a meeteing and we can not helpe it, for let us goe wheare we will, all is full wheare we are night and day”; had a great meeting “upon the first day [10 September]; the morneing the house and all was filled, and the streete, soe the voyce went forth fro a field [to meet in], and one there, wch was free had a me[a]dow [Earls-Mead], and we wente to it like an armey”; J.C. [John Camm] spoke; “He is exceedingly growne since I saw you. Wee have pure unitey in the life”; before he finished, “the word of the Lord came to mee, and when he had done, I stood up and all my bones smote togither and I was like a drunken man,… and I was made to cry like a woman in travell and to proclaime warr from the Lord with all the inhabilatents of the earth, and such a dreadfull voyce rang through me as I niver felte before, and the tirrer [terror] of the Lord toke hould upon harts and the trumpet sounded through the citty”; that afternoon, “we meet at the [Royal] Frote wheate souldiers are, the greatest meeting that ever I saw. It far exeded the greatest when I was with you, and all flesh was sillent and not one dog moved his toung [tongue]. A mighty meeteting we had in the counterey 3 mille of[f] [at Bishport]. This day we had a meeteing at a great house called Red Lodge, a gallent place for meeteing as we could desire. Ther[e] was as many people as was at the Forte”; no one uttered a word; have appointed a meeting “3 milles off the citty [at Filton] in Glostershire [Gloucestershire] on the 6 day [Friday, 15 September]. They are such people as I niver saw. They will spare noe paine. Hundreds went out of the citty to the last meeteing 3 mille of[f]. We shall stay heare over the first day, and further we know not how. You m[a]y writte to us to be heare the lats day of the weeke’; (Postscript- “After you have read this letter, inclose it and send it into the north to our deare wifes [Mabel Camm and Ann Audland], with this 2 litel on[e] [no longer with the letter]. Inclose them all in one”)

"Not long since I did receive order from thee as I understand, toe [to] get thy book [A Visitation to the Jewes; Wing F1978] toe the Jewes translated and printed in Hebrew, in which thing I have been diligent and have gotten it translated intoe Dutch, because he who is toe translate it into Hebrew cannot understand English and I have spoken with one who hath been a Jew toe translate it intoe Hebrew, but since I have understood that the common peopel of the Jewes cannot speak Hebrew but the greatest part can speak High Dutch and thearfore I with som[e] others, according toe oure knowledge of the thing, doe judge it would be of farr more service in High Dutch then in Hebrew, because it then would not only be of service for the Jewes, but likewise toe others and especially the latter part of it which might also be printed in High Dutch, for it is only the former part which I had order toe get printed in Hebrew, soe before it goes forward in Hebrew I doe expect toe hear from thee, for if it be in Hebrew, they who can read it will not and they who would...cannot. Here in this country (to wit, Vriesland), Truth hath som[e] entrance, but seeing I have been here but 2 or 3 dayes, I cannot write much of it. I left Friends at Amsterdam in good order. Som[e] of late are added toe them. I left John Higgens [Higgins] in Holland who is farr more fitt for that place because o[f] [his?] blam[e]les conversation then many others who have a greater name. I am taking my journy towards Hamburgh [Hamburg] at present, yet nevertheless, if Friendes or thou dost write, let it be sent toe Amsterdam as formerly it hath been. The work in these [parts?] begins toe increase and somthing of God is raised in many”;
(Postscript—[torn in several places]-”In that book which is printed against the Papists I [s]ee that that paper which I sent thee over last is [included?] and there is a nessessity that it should be answered, but no nesessity of printing of it”)

Abstract: [George Fox?] to W.R. [William Rogers] [this may be a continuation of number 219]
Dated: Bristoll [Bristol], 14 of 11 m. [January], [16]78[9] [Endorsed; however if this is a continuation of number 219, the date cited there is, 'Bristoll, ye 4th, 11th mo. [January], [16]78[9]'; see number 219; yet the body of this letter indicates the former date; see below]
Addressed:
Endorsed: G.F.'s answer to a letter of William Rogers about one S.H.'s letter, Bristoll, 14 of 11m., [16]78 [on side six; hand unidentified]
: An Answer to divers letters of W.R.'s and some part of their narative from Bristoll, some whereas was brought to G.F. by George Manserg [Mansergh] etc. [on side eight; hand unidentified]
Contents: Asks if his hand was not at "ye booke of above 30 pages wch you call 'A Breife Relation of Passages', and...with severall others, of many passages concer[n]ing ye meettings att Bristoll [Bristol; for these meetings see Braithwaite, Second Period, pp.314-315], contrary to order and agreement under thy owne hand and others then and there att Bristoll. And thou saith yt...J.H. [Joan Hiley; see number 219]...said that theise things was comonly reported. How should they be otherwise when you spread such things abroad contrary to your owne order wch every[one] yt reades your booke may see. Yett thou sayes thou would not have theise things any further spread, beleived or received, but thou had better have taken yt counsell...thy selfe, then thou would not have spread thy narative or relation, as you call it"; also as for "scandalizeing or belying of men of honesty, thou hadst better have aplyed yt att home William, for what has beene thy intent of spreading thy bookes or papers up and downe when soe many private letters and peices of passages thou hast sent up and downe. Thou would not have taken it well if an other should have done soe by thee, and hast not thou done this contrary to ye order and agreement att Bristoll, for was it not thy owne propossition yt nothing should be spread without consent or knowledge of both parties, and yt if anything was defective it might be amended, or any thing over or short it might be cor[r]ected before it went abroad?"; yet "thou hast gone contrary to this order in sending partes or peices of the things yt was spoken in ye meetting and other men's letters, without their consent or knowledge. And if thou and you doe continue to perswade yourselves yt G.F. hath not of late beene guided by ye spirit of Truth in all such matters relating to Truth wherein he hath concerned himselfe, as you say, instan[c]ing five quotations out of his booke to ye Womens Meetings [This is an Encouragement to all the Women's Meetings; Wing F1934], and yt you say you are not satisfied yt those who looke upon him as a man worthy of double honour and owne him in all such matters have had therin a spirituall diserning etc., I doe believe yt W.R. and ye rest would have it soe, but to say this [is] a lye or false, wch he, W.R. spreads up and downe contrary [to] order and without G.F's answer then given, this doth offend him and ye rest, and without ye consent of both parties as was agreed upon, to wch W.R. hand is att and others to be seene, but did not W.R. say yt to G.F. was fallen from ye Spirit of God, and then went and blotted it out againe in ye open meetting and made it as a charge at first, and afterwards theise things must be call[e]d 'disatisfactions'. Now if this be Truth or plain heartednesse, lett God and His people judge"; "All your hard words and speeches...touches me not"; also "thou sayes in ye end of your booke yt [it is?] a true copy of what was deliver[e]d to G.F. in ye presence of Will[iam] Ford, Edw[ard] Erbury and Cornelious Serjant [Sargent], wch was but a litle paper and not ye booke, and how can thou or they say soe, W.R., when G.F. told thee he would not receive it nor take it, for it is one thing to tender a thing and another thing to deliver it, but bad[e] thee prove what thou had written in thy paper, as many knows yt was present there at R.S. [Richard Snead's]. I am sory for you indeed yt you should publish such things abroad. There is many things in your booke to wch one might write a large vollume too, but I shall lett them be att present, but those quotations are answered in a booke by themselves with something touching liberty of true faith and tender conscience, and take heed yt under a pretence of liberty you doe not spoill yourselves and others"; "Hadst thou kept in ye simplic[i]ty and ye love of God,...thou would never have judged as thou hast done concerning my quotations", but rather would have seen "my innocent intent"; in 2 letters "brought by George Manserg [Mansergh] and Tho[mas] Hodgson thou sayes, one dated ye 11 of 11th mo. [January], [16]78[9] [if this date is correct, then this letter to William Rogers must be the 14th of the 11th month and not the 4th; see the dated portion above], and ye other noe date at all, in wch one signed by S.H. [unidentified], a letter to...W.R. [William Rogers], W.F. [William Ford], and others etc., how yt you sent your papers up and downe contrary to ye agreement att Bristoll. And have you not done it, though thou sayest those concerned in sending those relations abroad are noe covenant breakers therein, for thou sayes yt though ye agreement imports yt what was agreed upon by both parties to be recorded should be signed by six of each side, yett there is never a word, thou sayes, of agrrement or covenant yt nothing else should be sent abroad. But was there any thing to be sent abroad touching ye relations of ye proceedings in...[the] meettings without being signed with six Freinds on a side, and ye parties wordes was to be read to him to see yt his words were not wronged, nor taken by peice meall, nor that he might be made an offender for a word, but yt he might have liberty to expresse his owne sence thereof, and where, as thou sayes, yt ye order doth not say yt noe other paper should be sent forth, yt is nothing to ye purpose, but doth not those papers wch you have sent forth concerne ye meetting, and were they not sent forth before six of a side did see them...according to order and engagement, or read openly in ye meetting, for those papers wch you sent forth was concerning ye meetting and some part of my words what I should offer to ye meeting"; therefore, "why should you find soe much fault with S.H.? Did not you send your papers abroad to be read? And if any one takes notice of your papers to write to you againe of them, you are offended"; also, "thou sayes nothing was agreed upon to be recorded and those who have spread ye said relation abroad cheifly did it to accompany ye 'disatisfactions' etc."; "How can thou say it was nor [not] agreed upon? Doth not ye order say ye contrary and did not thou goe away in a passion from Richard Snead's, for was not ye order agreed and consented unto before ye meetting, and was not thy owne hand at it?'; was it fair to send the 'disatisfactions' abroad "without my answer what I said to them in ye meetting?...Yet some part of my words are sent abroad concerning a peace offering and left out anotherpart...And farther thou saith a copy whereof was deliver[e]d to W.P. [William Penn], 'the great agent for thee [George Fox],...and if thou should pretend thou never saw it, it's suficient to manifest thee a man void of all good consceince, for my eyes were wittnesse thou did see it and ye copy given W.P. was made use of before thy face in ye meetting'. Will[iam] Rogers and ye rest, is there not many things ad[d]ed more to that wch was given to William Pen? Was ye relations of ye 4 meettings given to him? Did my eyes see those things in yt paper or booke wch are charges or 'dissatis[f]actions', as thou calls them, and was all ye papers yt passed betwixt W.P. and thee in yt booke wch thou made use of att ye Friers [one of the Friends meeting houses in Bristol]? And ye litle paper yt thou drew up att R. Snead's? Did my eyes see all theise papers in ye booke wth ye severall other passages of ye meettings and when it was given to W.P., wch I doe declare I did not. And if thou calls my saying this being void of all good consceince, thou mayst goe on"; in the title page, "you say it's 'A Breife Relation of some Passages hapening among ye People called Quakers since ye Late coming of G.F. [George Fox], G.W. [George Whitehead], W.P. [William Penn] and others to ye City of Bristoll cheifly for ye Sake of those who desire to know ye Substance of Materiall Passages'...Was this ye title of yt booke yt...was given to W.P., and part of it read att ye Freirs, wch my eyes see and made use of in ye meetting?...But ye title of this and ye title of ye other will manifest whether it be ye same"; also, "did not I and Freinds call to you to read up your charges wch you call 'disatisfactions'?...And since, thou desires an answer to the letter signed...S.H. [for this letter, dated "the 9th of the 6th mo. [August], [16]78", see William Rogers, The Fifth Part of the Christian-Quaker, pp.12-15], saying 'tis much to be doubted thou art ye occasion thereof', since thou sayes you doe not understand yt any other hath beene ye cause of spreading of thy and others being covenent breakers on yt occassion of meetting with thee and others, and so would...make me informer agst S.H., and yett saith in thy letter of ye 4th, 11 mo. [January], [16]78[9] [see Rogers, The Fifth Part of the Christian-Quaker, p.19] that it was nothing more then what was comonly reported, whereupon this report being soe comon J[oan] Hilly [Hiley] shewed thee my letter [for part of this letter, see Rogers, The Fifth Part of the Christian-Quaker, p.18], soe it seemes this was a comon report about Bristoll before I writ my letter to Joan Hely [Hiley], and therefore how in truth or justice can thou say yt I was ye originall spreader of thy and others being covenant breakers,...and thy with T.G. [Thomas Gouldney; 'T.G.' is in fact crossed through, yet Rogers, in his Fifth Part etc., p.20 mentions this letter and that Thomas Gouldney was one of the writers of it] and W.F. [William Ford] your letter was dated 'ye 11th of ye 11th mo. [January, 1678/9]', and for thee to query therein if any others had spoken any such words, and in thy letter of ye 4th, 11th mo. [January, 1678/9] thou saith it was a comon report as in Joan Hilly letter, and therefore thou and ye rest might have spared to have made me informer"; must allow "truth [to] oversway thy passion,...for thou and you cannot cleare your practice from being guilty of breaking ye order yt was read in ye meetting, neither hast thou done it"; must "come downe into humillity" or risk the wrath of the Lord, especially considering "my tendernes towards thee, and how thy cariage hath beene and how thou art changed and how many occassions thou hast made at quarells and strife with out any just occassion"; yet the Lord "knowes my innocency"; there are many things "I might take occassion of, for all thy hard expressions if I went to answer all thy papers"; if his [W.R.'s] actions have been "keeping covenant or order, then what is breaking of it? Would thou and W.F. [William Ford] account such covenant or order keepers and under their owne handes, if others should have done soe to them? And must not W.R. and W.F. and ye rest be told of it when they have done doe, but it must be accounted of an evill consequence? Ye truth of it is you should not have done it without ye consent of Freinds, and if you thinke it be of creditt to you, you may keep...it, and if this be your liberty of consceince you may keepe yt alsoe, but take heed yt ye end of it be not everlasting bondage"; could write a great deal "if there was an eare without prejudice"; yet, "whatsoever you say of me I heed it not, for I know what I have beene and what I am to ye Lord"; asks that the Lord "forgive thee and you all for all your hard words and acctions done or spoke[n] ag[ain]st me,...and yt you may find a place of repentance. And truly it was in my mind once to have sent your papers backe againe and never to have taken notice of them, for there is many things in them hardly worth takeing notice of"; "I doe not feare what...you nor any one can doe or say ag[ain]st mee,...for I said before ever ye Lord sent me to preach ye everlasting, peaceable gospell what spirits would rise ag[ain]st me, soe it trobles not mee"; (lengthy postscript in a different hand, but by George Fox- "And many papers wch I have had from thee and others wch as yett I have not answered, the large paper wch thou sent me to Swarthmoore [Swarthmoor] and another wch thou sent me to London, and afterwards two more, wch att Bristoll thou wouldst not stay to make good, and besides y[ou]r booke wch was never sent to mee from thee, and other papers wherein thou hast published my name, and ye 2 last papers wch thou sent to Kendall [Kendal] wch came to...me by G[eorge] Manserg [Mansergh] and Tho[ma]s Hodgson, when quickly after G.M. [George Mansergh] went distracted, who was your clarke and spreader of your papers abroad, wch they confessed they had taken copies of and shewed to others, though they brought them to me sealled, wch I have not gone about to take ye advantage to answer by setting one of thy and your papers and booke ag[ain]st another to thy and your disadvantage as I might,...hopeing yt in time you will come to see and judge them yoursellves, and returne and see your sellves how you went out, but if thou doe persist [to] print and publish, then they must be published, wee being forced therto and wch will not be to ye creditt of ye authors,...Therefore you had better study to be quiett...and come to your first love, and all your hard speeches and carriage to me and entertainment yt I had amongst you att Bristoll without cause or ground, and contrary to thy owne promise, W.R., when I sent to thee to lett me have but ye same dealeing att Bristoll as was shewed to thee att London concerning R.B. [unidentified] booke, but the end of yt promise did manifest it selfe, who there brought charges ag[ain]st me publickly in a publicke meetting without giveing me a coppy of it before or makeing good yt wch thou had sent to London before. Now if this was faire, eyther like sober men of ye world, or Christians, lett ye wittnes of God in all judge"); [on side seven, there appears what is probably the good copy of most of the postscript of this letter, given above, and signed by G.F., though not in his hand]

Recieved an Epistle from them "touching someting yt passesd at our Quarterly Meeting, 1680 [see numbers 46-49] at ye house of Ralph Fretwell wch was indirectly managed here and sent for England and elsewhere wthout our knowledge or consent wch we are sensible hath caused hurts and griefes wth us and griefe and trouble to you and other tender Friends"; as for the paper, "it was not sent abroad by us or our order...but was a griefe to us w[he]n we heard it was abroad and we jusged ye same ye first Quarterly Meeting after, otherwise called our Yearly Meeting at Rich[ard] Sutton's ye last first month [March], 1681, severall months before any notice from any other place touching it"; if they had intended to publish it or send it abroad, they would have "communicated it to some good Friend abroad (for approbation or service) wch we find ourselves clear of"; however some did gain it "or rather part of it" off of a particular Friend, which was to be read only, and yet "sent it privately abroad wth dislike...before giving notice of ye same"; at the last Quarterly meeting "ye 10th month [December], ye 13th day, 1681" held at Ral[ph] Fretwell's, the paper was ordered "to be taken out of our Quarterly Meeting book, and yo[u]r testimony unanimously submitted unto and placed in ye same instead...[and] we again did declare against spreading of it or any other papers yt might grieve or hurt any"; however one did seem "to justufie ...yt such papers might be sent abroad by ym yt did disapprove of ye same as he had done, wch Friend was not at ye Quarterly Meeting before at Ral[ph] Fretwell's or mentioned his sending it abroad, "Friends would have been more circumspect in making it,... for Friends did see and were sensible yt it was not only a griefe unto us, but unto some moderate men of ye world in the island yt some particulars amongst us were not so ready, as they might be, to hearken to ye advice of ye Apostle, 1 Cor[inthians], 6 ch[apter]"; admit that "we should have hinted...of ye great love, freedome, tenderness, brokenness and liberty yt was in yt said meeting expressed"; it was "a day of love and liberty and choice and not of constraint"; as for the paper "or short memorial, it was too short and not well expressed, more especially for such as was not at ye said meeting, and where it is expressed 'or whether you will give up unto ye judgm[en]t unto their own particular or particulars only' (wch is wrong copied), 'wth wch ye judgm[en]t generall of ye meeting have not unitie', it should also have been expressed, as it was ye sence of ye meeting (viz)' those particular judgm[en]ts wch have or were come unto a loss in ymselves, or have lost their beloved',...as the Scriptures testifie, and was spoke by us in ye meeting"; must emphasize that "as we expressed more large in ye Quarterly Meeting, for us to press upon Friends our public judgmt of ye Quarterly Meeting against any particular measure of ye spirit of God in any particular, were it our intention or practise or judgmt, it is by us judged as wrong wch was never in our hearts so to do, but to be helpful to ye dim sighted, lame, maimed ot strayed, we believe it is a Christian duty and practise"; are sorry for any grief they have caused; yet "as ye feare of ye living God is departed from yt Covenant of Light, ye Law of Jesus is cast behind ye back and ye day is darkned and full of clouds and mists, and ye more any wander from ye Father's house into ye by-wayes of their own inventions wch genders more into strife and other hurtfull lusts to ye disquiet of ymselves and ye heritage of God and ye derision of such as have not known ye Lord,...and if we or any other gives any judgm[en]t against this Light or ye least true measure if it in any, we go against ye univerall sp irit and wisesom of God wch alone ought to rule and govern to order all things in our men and womens meetings, and not ye judgmt of any men or women esteemed elders out of ye same spirit and measure of true Light in any particulat or particulars is wrong and judged by us"; a true copy examined by Rich[ard] Ford

Is refreshed “on your behalf, who the Lord is faithfull and keeps in His counsel, wch preserves out of the world and out of the temtations”; would be glad “if the Lord give[s] me to see your faces wch I know is buteyfull”; however, “I can say little whether it will be ordered for me to see you, though the travell ne noething, but in the will of God I waite to be derected”; as for Stephen Hub[bersty], “it’s like I can not git him word to meete you. He is gone aboute 20 mille[s] hence up into the Forest in Glostershire [Gloucestershire] and there is a meeteing tomorow [of] a few prety people wch longs much. I was once among them. It is a sutable place for him and he is prety bould and increaseth. His love was dearely to you remembered”; love to “deare G[eorge Fox] if he be there, and to J.N. [James Nayler] and A.P.

It doth not answer mine [possibly The Innocent Delivered out of the Snare; Wing A4196], yet it’s like I shall write a little to it [possibly The School-Master Disciplin’d; Wing A4197]. I have begun it allredy, but it’s soe silley few doth regard it, onely the filthy spirit from wherin it cam[e], but amonge the Childeren of Light it will not stand”; the two Johns [Wilkinson and Story] are in Wiltshire “as farr as I know”; “I would have you to pay Gilles [Giles] Calvert £20 upon [Nicholas?] Jordan’s acounte for books and I shall take it heare of him. It is gone alredy for Freinds that was in n[e]cessestey [necessity] that traveled this way”; £14 of it went to T.R. [Thomas Robertson] and A.R. [Ambrose Rigge] while some also went to S.H.

Frinds tould him it was thare desire yt thinges might be ended betwixt ye widow and R.B., for they weare eagrely [eagerly] conserned for both thare good. Soe severall Frinds heare and sevrell from Newcasell [Newcastle] mett att my house with him, and in ye end we came to this result, yt ye M[aste]r of ye ship, Danyell [Daniel?] Leeds [?] should goe with him into Scotland to make an end with ye widow and childer [children] and gitt what pasingers they could amonge themselves yt the damige might be as litell as could be, and unto this J[ohn] Swintton [Swinton] was very willinge and redey to lend his helpinge hand, and allsoe it was concluded yt I should write unto you 2 [George Fox and George Whitehead] to aquainte you heare with, and to desire you yt you wo[ul]d use your indevers to spope [stop] all reports and perticuerely [particularly] speake to Geo[rge] Watt [Watt’s] man and R[obert] Sandland [Sandilands] (when he comes to towen) that they doe not conserne then selves to tallke of things being in away we hope to be ended.

I supose ye will fine my words thus, yt I did not percive [perceive] they intended to marey untill they came unto Amirica intending thareby to informe you yt thare would be time for Frinds...to interpose and devertt them from thare intentions, beinge thare maryeinge could not be consistentt with Truthe’s testimoney, butt now we percave and J[ohn] Swintton declared soe much amonge Frinds heare yt they who oposed ye maridge in Scotland, did not doe it upon ye acounte of thare affinity, butt upon othor [other] grounds, and whearas ye M[aste]r of ye ship, Danyell Leeds and myselfe did percave yt som[e] had reported as though we had used som[e] argements to draw ye widow and chillder [children] into ye bargan [bargain] to fright [freight?] ye ship, we desired J[ohn] Swintton to speake [h]is mynde [mind],...which he very freely did, and haith lefft a paper under his hand to cleare us, yt we wear soe fare [far] from seleing [sealing] ye bargan, as yt we raither disied [desired] to decline it, beinge ye M[aste]r of ye shipp could then have had frights [freights] att 2 outher [other] hands as benefichell [beneficial] to him (or more) then this could be, butt thare earnestnes with him prevailed, not knowinge butt they could be in a condition to performe with him. And deare Georges [Fox and Whitehead], I have heare sentt a few lines to be given to R.S. [Robert Sandilands].

Another Frinde hear had allsoe writen of ye same matter to him butt I telling him I had write[n] I supose he will stop his. I question not your tender care for ye young man, as we have and I hope shall be of his repute and creditt. I should have bene verey glad to have seine him att his goeinge by, butt I did not heare of his beinge att Newcasell [Newcastle] untill he was gon[e], for G[eorge] Watt [Watt’s] man writes to me he knowes R.S. had nothinge in his mynde ever to either of Simmons’ daughter[s], soe this may putt him in away to clear himselfe as to whatt hapned [happened] heare conserninge ye man’s daughter ment[i]oned though Frinds was troubled att it, ye man beinge a rich, earthly man and redy to take ocation att it, yeatt Frinds was willing to hide and beare thinges butt now his denyinge of it is...a grefe to ym [them].

On that day at the Nisi Prius bar, “ye cause of ye widow and fatherless was turned backward, true witness being taken for false and false for true. I being then present (and being 3 times concerned, once before Judge [Sir Thomas] Jones [the inclusion of Jones implies that this was an ongoing case, for he had been dismissed on 21 April 1686], thyself and 3 more), can not now but ease my self of what was said upon me, and warn you not to run upon ye Quakers, and seek to bastardize their children, some of you saying upon ye Bench sometime that we take one another’s wor[d] [to] go toget[her] as whores and rogues, yet before some your law hath [the remainder of the letter i.e. two lines and the signature, is badly damaged; however, it would appear that this letter relates to an inheritance to a widow and her children, and thus calls into question a Quaker marriage; the last two lines may indicate that the Law has in other cases upheld Quaker marriages]

As concerning sudden marriages, after the death of a husband or wife, the wor[l]d “has reproached us by their owne Proverb: that if a man or a woman marry before 12 months be expired, they are not cold in the grave”; in any case, Friends “should have a litle more chastity and dominion over their spirits then the people of ye world, for Fr[ien]ds professing a faith, light and life beyond ym, therefore they should shew forth more vertue then the, and you may read the Law of Widdowhood and mourning: the Jewes antiquities explaines it more fully”; Friends should be examples “to ye world, and be examples in chastity, virtue and patience in all those things”; as concerning Hen[ry] Bull “shooting to death soe many horses comeing on his ground, that he should not have done, but have pounded them and given them meat to have kept them alive till the owners had released them, and if they had trespassed, itt should have been tried by a jury, or by arbitration to see how his fence was and what ye damage was and he must not be judge and executioner in his owne matter, nor any man in such cases depending amongst neighbours. Therefore this thing must be referred to men to judge and determine the matter. I am sorry to hear of such things, for they are an ill example in your island and will sett ye world over you and excourage [encourage] them to do the like actions, and then say the Quakers lead them to itt, and of such actions as these bee, (with their hasty marriages below ye world and falling into strife and contention about them, and loose the power of God wch should keep you in virtue, unity and peace) have a care and take heed least the Lord…bring the World over you in Gover[n]m[en]t to chasetiss [chastize] you, and therefore lett all such things as these are be judged, for noe Friend in Truth can owne them, and be att unity amongst yourselves in the Lord’s power, both in your Men and Womens meetings and all other meetings, and lett Hen[ry] Bull make restitution for  ye horses according as men shall judge both of his fence and trespasse to stopp all such bad examples, and as they shall judge what damage the horses did him, and soe cleer the Truth of his passion throughout the Iland [Island], for his doings are contrary both to ye Law of God and Man, and such actions brings a reproach upon ye Governm[en]t, and ye Governers should take notice of such things, and I am sorry that any such ill action should have been done in your gover[n]m[en]t,…and I doe hear yt An[n] Eason [Easton nee Clayton] soon after …Hen[ry] Bull’s wife was deceased, that shee should bee in company with H.B. [Henry Bull] upon which a discourse about marriage was raised, but I hope better things of her and Joshua Coxhall, that they will be wiser and have more reputation for the Truth and themselves, not that I deny marriage, but yt [they] may have patience and do things to ye honour and glory of God,…and soe remem[ber] me to Peter Eason [Easton] and Jos[eph] Nicholson and Robert Hodgson,…[and] alsoe to the Governour [of Rhode Island?] and to old W[illia]m Coddington, and tell him I have sent his book [probably Coddington’s A demonstration of True Love; Wing C4875] to bee printed”; love to all Friends “yt queries after mee” and to Arthur Cook of he should “come into your Island”; also Alex[and]er Parker and Jo[hn] Burnyeat “being present, remember dear love to thee and to all Friends”

His name is Mathew Hudginson [Hutchinson] [who] has bene amongst us once before two years agoe”; this time he “suffered shipwrack… goeing from ye north towards Loondon, upon [the] Suffolk coast, and soe came hether in ye packet=boat from Harwich.

"Thine this day I have received, dated in London the 6 [day] of ye first mo. [March, 1660/1], which is noe small refreshing to me in a strange land where wickedness abounds"; her love is dear to him and "in the eternall", he is engaged to her; the Lord has given her a discerning spirit "whereby thou knowest that my sould loveth thee"; "Since I came out of the Palatinate (where I was som time with oure dear Friends there, and was with the Prince [Charles Louis?] who shewed more friendship then ever, but because I doe thinck that my dear bro[ther] W.C. [William Caton] hath given thee an account of passages, I omitt the perticulers), I have travelled through many dominions and through Bohemia, but the power of darkness hath the possession of al[l]. The people are generally slaves within and without. When I have told them of the wickedness of theire priests, they confes it and confes the wickednes of theire rulers, and theire owne wickednes and confes to the Truth, but say they, "we must doe as oure lords will have us or else we may not live here, for we are theirs; we must both doe and beleeve as they will have us', and with this spirit is the multitudes guided...In this citty I have been above 2 weeks...[and] the wickednes is hard to be mentioned. Truth is acknowledged by som[e], but they are not worthy of it. This citty borders upon Poland which is the place intended when I came from the Palatinate, yet not this side of the country. Therefore, tomorrow, I intend to take my journy by water towards Dantzick [Danzig] and that side of Poland which at present lyes upon me. Travilling is difficult...I have an honest man with me, a Friend of Palatine, who could not be cleare to let me pass alone...Love to thy daughter M[argaret Fell, jr] and H.F. [Henry Fell] and the rest of the Friends with thee";

(Postscript from W.C. [William Caton]--"Since the sealeing up of my letter for England, I have even now received this acceptable letter for thee. I tooke speciall care of thine to get it to him though he was farre remote in a strang[e] land, and likewise it was upon me to be diligent in letting him know (according to his yearnest desire) how it was with Friends in England. I have little to acquaint thee with at present besides what I have writt to E.B. [Edward Burrough] which I desire yt thou may have a sight of. Dear W.A. [William Ames] desires me to give dear G[eorge Fox] an account of those thinges which he hath here writt to thee, but of that I shall discharg[e] my selfe by referring it to thee, hopeing that you will not be farre destant at thy receipt hereof. It is my desire very much to hear of Friends in ye North but especially of the dear children who are soe often in my thoughts, yet from none of them doe I hear, neither doe I know very well by whom I shall hear of them, expecting it be thy selfe...Though I have not for some weekes writt perticularly to thee, yet it was my desire that you might see that which I wrote to others"; love to her and to Margrett [Margaret Fell, jr] "and to all thy dear babes at home")

I could have been glad to have seen thy sons John [Rous] and Willyam [William Yeamans], but itt semes it could not be”; heard recently from London “of the dapatrure out of the bodie of dear Will[iam] Catton [Caton] at Amsterdam for…which I am very sorry, for… he was verey pillor of that cuntrie…[and] when I consider of the takeing away of soe many faythfull men which could and would have done most service for the Lord in our generation, [it] makes my harte sad… though as for them I canot so much be sorey for they are att rest with and in the Lord ans itt’s only their personall presence that we want in the body, for their life and spirit wee injoy”; there is “a badd book [A Sermon Preached…Aug. 17, 1664; Wing S4005] come forth of one Doctor [Allan] Smallwodd’s [Smallwood], a sermon preached att Carlile [Carlisle] beffor the judge [the Judges in that circuit at that date were Sir Christopher Turnor and Sir Thomas Twisden] with greatt aditions to itt and printed att Yorke [York] upon that subjecte, swear nott att all, and from that Scripture he hath gone about to prove the laffullnesse [lawfulness] of swearing. He hath read, I p[er]seive, many of our writings, a very cuning, subtill, bad man. He semes to answer all object[i]ons and arguments layd down by us and semes to run down all and ride over all. His booke makes a greate noyse in Yorkshir[e] and these count[ies]. I am vexed with it, and seeing we have written so much about [it] [I some]time thinke itt’s inough and agayne what more can I say, yett agay[ne] [one] thinks itt’s pitty such a son of Anack should come…and bost [boast]… and glory over Treuth and all Freinds suffering. I am constrayned me thinkes to say something, though I confesse I would much rather some other Frend would have written, for he is learned man in letters and is full of authors and quottations and scripture,… but I have little of those weapons”; therefore, “I must content myselfe with a bag and a smouth stone and trust to the power of the Lord to give him a knocke and sett the simplicity of Tueth above him, and though it convince none, yett if wee keep our owne in this day of opossision and blasphemy, itt’s well from faynting”

He reads them “in the Light of the New Covenant” where he is present with them “though absent in body”; they have all been found worthy by God “of this high calling”; received the letter they
sent from Camebridge [Cambridge] ; “I shortly went into the Isle of Eley [Ely] and I had meetings at Eley Towne and was moved to goe to the steeple, but the rude people would not
suffer mee to speake, but...I was preserved and I had a great meeting in ye towne yt day” and many were convinced; However “ the towne is much hardended ageanst the Truth”; yet there is
“a preety people a coming on at Litleport [Littleport] in the Isle” where he remained “a cirtayne space among them, and there is about 60 yt are brought to meet togather alone in yt towne”, one
of whom was “moved to go naked and to go so to a captayne’s house, an Independent professrt, and the towne was much inraged and set him in ye stockes all night;” on the following first day,
“I had a meeting at a place called Soam [Soham], within 3 miles of Collon [el Francis] Rus[se]ll’s and ther I was moved to goe to the steeplehouse and there was a London priest gotten up into
ye seate of ye Pharisy and hee was right pharisy, for hee was much paynted”; stayed there till he had finished “and then I was caried out in a mighty power to speake to him and to ye
people...and they was a very great people and rude, but yw power of God was wonderfully seene...and the throng was great, soe I pressed forth into the yard and there they made way for
mee ans I was moved to speake... and they stood even like lambes about me,and at last there came one Rob[ert] Hamond [Hammond], called a justice, who had beene at the steeplehouse and hee sayd yt there was a Proclamation [given forth by Oliver Cromwell on 15 February, 1654/5] yt all who disturbed ye minister in ye time of his publique exersise should bee aprehended as
disturbers of the peace, so if I would not passe away,...i should bee aprehended, so I was free to passe from yt place, but I tould him ans ye people yt I should declare ye Truth in ye towne yt
day”; in fact, “I had a greate meeting in the towne yt day” where several “of ye people yt belonged to those people [Independents?] at Chipnam [Shippenham, in Cambridgeshire]” but apparently there were “none yt came out of the towne”; however, those that were there “received ye Truth willingly” and many were convinced, “and there was a man yt was moved to come from Littleport and stand naked among ye people in ye meeting...but I knew nothing of it untill it was dunne [done], and many of ye world stumbled and ye enimy gotte some advantage there, but ye people was much silent and quiet, though there was some startleing smong them of ye world”, yet many were well satisfied “who had a capacity to receive”; however all of this “went to Hamond’s [Hammond’s] eare” and he and the priests consulted “and ye next morning hee sent a warren[t] for mee and comitted mee to Cambridge gaole for speakeing to the priest”; was sent to
Cambridge “on ye last 2d day” and was put into “ye low gaole among[s]t ye theives, and on ye next day, justice [James] Blackley sent his warrant and set mee free...of his owne accord”; on
the next day “I went to a meeting six miles from Cambridge where I met with...An[n] Blakely [Blaykling] and Dorathy [Dorothy] Waugh” who remain in those parts; his [Parnell] release and
going into the country was serviceable “for ye heathen was much excalted [exhalted] and rejoyced at my imprisonment”; intends to pass “shortly bake [back] into those partes where I was
taken, for ther is a people there to bee brought forth”; heard that Russille’s [Colonel Francis Russell] “was then at London, but ye heathen...is plotting together to gett mee into prison ageane,
for ye gaoler hath beene with Blackley about it and is trubled in mind because hee let mee go without bayle and threatens to gette anohter warrant for mee”; is content whether in or out of
bonds “but I have thoughtes to bee heare aboutes untill ye next returne, if you have moveinges to write anything”; [James] Jolly [Jollie], “ye scoller [scholar], is come to ye towne, but hee is in
litle servisse. Hee is come to see about some meanes yt is due to him in ye Colledge [Trinity College, Cambridge], for they have not yet put him out and hee hath gotten some monies of them”; love to G.F. [George Fox] and “I shall bee glad to heare from George or any of you”

I have by me manuscripts of many subjects relateing to the primitive order and how it came to be lost, and then what fopperies and fooleries, externals borrowed from Judaism entred, and how the same or great resemblances thereof is continued in churches pretending to reformation.

Then how came W[illiam] Rogers to yt false certificate of thine, and thou sa[i]st there was one by us at thy father [Nathaniel] Cripps’ court [Cripps had been a Justice of the Peace in Gloucestershire] made answer yt shee heard me advise thee to buy it, to wit, ye tyths, but what ‘shee’ it was, thou hast not named, neither in print nor writeing...[nor] when I examined thee. I doe not remember any such thing, but thou seemed to be low in thy Sp[iri]t then and seemed to find fault or be displeased with thy father and said yt thou would have had him to have written to me before he gave forth his certificate, but it seemes thy mind is altered who hath given forth one thy self [see William Roger’s The Fifth Part of the Christian Quaker, pp. 54-55] without ever writeing to me and it seems thou hast now got a ‘shee’ witness, but there is noe such to thy printed certifycate, and how darest thou say yt I did not deny it at yt time when we were face to face, and twice over thou tells me of denying ye Truth. Yt is like thy false certificate and thy witness. Oh, Robert, ye day was when thou durst not a spoken such things, and Robert, thou sa[i]st’for ye day, month and year when thee didst soe advise me it was yt very day (or else) ye morrow yt Alixander [Alexander] Parker did read in my...house thy order to Friends as advise how to acte at y monthly or Quarterly meeting,...and it was yt very year yt thee kept the first Quarterly Meeting at...Henry Rogers’ at Hedington [Heddington}’”; if he [Robert Arch] had only “signified soe much to me before thou had given forth thy certificate with out year, day or month, it had been something like a civill man, but now it’s spread and printed, I must goe examine Alixander Parker ye day, month and year of thy false certificate, and thou dost not say what year it was I kept yt Quarterly Meeting at Hedington, soe I say thy memory may fail ye in thy certificate...I say thy memory may fail thee in that as well as it doth in not remembering ye day, month and year”; “Thou would have me ‘in coolness and ye fear of ye Lord to consider of ye great division amongst Friends... yt is known publickly to proffessor and profaine...as is among[s]t those yt profess ye Truth. Ye like never saw amongst Friends Before thy orders came forth as have been since, although it was reprted they were given forth to keep Friends in a good order or for ye good order of Friends’”; denies their is any division among “true and faithfull Friends in ye Truth”; if he [Robert Arch] had kept “in ye coolness, humility and fear of ye Lord, thou would never given such a certificate behind my back nor suffer it to be printed, and such a certificate behind my back nor suffer it to be printed, and such disorderly doeings were like to bring you into division, strife and confussion, and you did seem to own them and receive them in love when ye first Quarterly Meeting was settled among you”; feels that “you had better study to be quiet and call in thy false certifycate wch is spread up and down behind my back amongst priests, justices, professor and profane, wch hath shewed a malicious, envious sp[iri]t and not ye Sp[iri]t of Xt [Christ],...and ye Sp[iri]t in thoe wch hath gievn forth yt certificate and spread it abroad would have taken away my life if it had power, as well as my reputation, but my life is out of ye reach of your power of darkness, and thou sa[i]st yt I did formerly declare agt such as kept on there hates in prayer and call’d it’a rotten principle of ye Ranters’ and thou sa[i]st ‘such as are ye great observers of thy orders are ye men found in ye practice’...and thou hast not heard yt I have repreoved them. I have little cause to tell ye what I have done who hath writen a false certificate behind my back, and it is hard for Friends to put of[f] their hats to such a Sp[iri]t, and thou hast not mentioned what persons they are yt prays and others yt keep on their hats yt I should reprove, and I say still it was ye Ranters principle, but... I never said it was ye Ranters principles to keep on their hats to ye priests prayer, but theire is some in tenderness of conscience can noe more put of[f] their hats to dead formall prayers noe more then they can doe to ye priests who are in a Sp[iri]t of oppossion to ye...Truth”; “Why should thou or any impose it upon them or find fault with them. You had better have seen what had been ye cause in yourselves, and thou goes over and over in thy paper telling og my ‘orders’ rather scoffingly than Christianly” “Why...dost thou trouble thy selfe about laying marriages before ye womens meetings as well as ye mens, for I never gave forth a paper to ye contrary, and why should ye womens meetings be dispised, seeing it is in ye female as well as ye male a faithfull true witness of God’s Joyning, and why should not Xt in ye women see into marriages as well as...in men, and there is none but loose, wilfull, unrury and disorderly Sp[iri]ts yt are agt it and they yt keep in ye unity...and fellowship in ye Sp[iri]t and Truth doe own ye Sp[iri]t of truth in ye women as well as in ye men, and such are not ashamed to lay their marriages before ye womens meeting as well as ye mens yt ye Sp[iri]t of Truth may see it,...and thou sa[i]st my counsell was in ye said paper yt nother should be recored for mony but freely, but of late have heard yt Friends did pay for ye recording of a certificiate of his marriage in London, but thou hast not said who told ye this report and who it was yt paid for it, and who took mony for it. Thou should have gone to London and have searcht it out and have spoke[n] to ye partyes before thou had been a busy body to have declared it, and thou sa[i]st in my book of orders it is writen, ‘tale carryers whose work it it to sow desiention are to be reproved’. R.A., Art not thou ye man yt hast told me a tale of one paying for a certifycate and not mentioning neither of their names, and was not thou a sower of descention when thou gave forth a false certificate behind my back?...And I...am nor have not been...guilty to hearken or to countence tale carryers nor railers nor sowers of descention amongst Friends,...and thou sa[i]st’when I was at thy father [Nathaniel] Cripp’s house, thou did tell tales and rail and revile in a mocking, unseemly manner at some Friedns, and thy mother Cripps reproved thee’. Now R.A., thou hast manifest[ed] thy Sp[iri]t and it had been well for thee and thy mother had yee take[n] my counsell and advise, then you had not fallen into thy condition, and what I said was Truth, not ‘tal[e]s and revileings in a mocking, unseemly manner,’ as thou maliciously calls it,...but thou hast not said what Fri[en]ds those were,...and thou sa[i]st how yt many of those who are zealous of my orders doe in their preaching and praying with ye hearers make such a singing and humming noi[se] yt many times one can scarce understand what is said”; are not there in fact “tales and reportes thou tells me agt Friends without nameing their names, but mockingly and scoffingly sa[i]st they are ‘zealous of thy orders’, such as hum and sing, but why doe your preachers preach while others sing?...It seems you are got into ye priests sp[irit] and that cannot be bowed to, and thou sa[i]st, ‘ye bad words, actions and wicked fruits yt are brought forth by thy adherers, with railings, revileings in many places and meetings and falling out with Fri[en]ds’, and here is more of thy reports and tales, but dost not tell ye names of ye Friends and ye meetings. I question whet[h]er thou hast spoken to them, but thou mockingly and scoffingly sa[i]st ‘wch things are brough forth by thy adherers’. and thou would have me...to write yt Friends should not judge and condem one another about my orders as thou scoffingly sa[i]st...I doe not know of any true and faithfull Friends yt do judge and condem one annother about them, nor do sleight them...for all true Friends and brethren...know their Xtian [Christian] liberty and freedome in ye government of Xt’s peaceable kingdome, and thou art teaching of me what I and others should write to put a stop to’those sad and wofull divisions’. You should cease from those sad and wofull divisions among yourselves and come to yt wch did first convince you,...for if you had all been faithfull to ye Light of Xt and Truth of God you never come to this nor never have done as you doe,...and when ye Mens Meetings was first settled amongst you, thou and others did not scofin[g]ly call them ‘directoryes’,...but many knows yt yt wch was given forth then did answer ye Truth. Thou sa[i]st ‘the fruits of some of thy party have manifest[ed] it, to wit, ye defilem[en]ts of ye world’. Here thou art a tale teller or a reporter or acusor without nameing ye persons or noe, and thou sa[i]st thou cannot say certainly whether thou didst give W[illia]m Rogers...licence or authority to print thy certificate...Here it seems thy memory fails thee as it did about day, month and year...And thou sa[i]st at yt time when I was with ye[e] at thy father’s house ye last, I did not deny it, to wit, ye adiviseing thee to buy of[f] tyth[e]s when we were face to face, and then thou sa[i]st ag[ai]n,...if I had said as I did to thee, when I was at thy father’s house, yt I could not remember yt I did soe advise thee, thou sa[i]st then i had done something like an hunest man. Here thou may see thy folly and contradiction”; “What you have sown you will reap...except thou doe repent and...call in thy certificate and acknowledge thou hast done me wrong”; “I doe advise thee and ye rest to be low and humble, meek and gentle” and come to live and walk in the Truth “yt it may bring thee out of this sp[iri]t of stife and back biteing and telling of tales or mocking at them yt hums and why should not them yt sings have liberty of conscience to sing in your meeting. I do not look upon ye[e] a competent judge whether they sing in grace or noe. Therefore thou had better judge thyself and brindle thy tongue” and repent

Contents" Received a letter "from thee dated from London, the 20th of the 11th mo[n]th [January], 1682/3 wherein thee desirest to know of me whether or noe I did give Will[ia]m Rogers licence or authority to print [in The 5th Part of the Christian Quaker, pp. 54-55] a false certifycate against thee"; in fact, never wrote "a false certificate against thee neyther did I ever give way to the printing such a one"; however, "I did write a true certifycate concernige thy advice to me to buy my tyth[e] of[f] the impropriators, which since [I] under[stand] thee denyest that thee didest soe advise me"; sorry to see him "denyinge The Truth, [for] the last time that thee wast with me at my father [Nathaniel] Cripp's at Upton [in Gloucestershire where Cripps was a Justice of the Peace], I remember that in his court thee examenest me about it, when and where it was, and I tould thee, and thou askest me whoe heard it besides my selfe and there was one by us made answer that she heard thee advise me to buy it,  and then at that time thee didest not deny it when wee were face to face"; little thought "in times past that thou wouldest deny the Truth, as in this thee hast done. As for the day, mo[n]th and yeare when thee didest soe advise me, it was that very day (or elce the morrow) that Alexander Parker did read in my house thy orders or epistles to Friends as advise how to act at the Mo[n]thly and Quarterly Meettings, and it was that very yeare that thee keept the first Quarterly meettinge (soe called) in our county at Hentry Rogers'es [Rogers'} at Hedington [Heddington}. Therefore examine  Alexander Parker when he was with thee at my house and did thy orders,... and tis like he may further satisfie thee about it"; there are also some things "that doe ly[e] upon me to write to thee about which I doe earnistly desire thee in coolenes and humillity and the feare of the Lord" to consider, "and that is about the great divisions that is amongst Friends, both in theire publicke meettings for the worshippe of God, and otherwise (Soe that it is become publicke and knowne to professors and prophane) which hath caused great sorrow and griffe to many honest hearted Friends, soe that I doe really beleive that there is not amongst any sosiety of professors this day in England soe much strife and division, with amongst those that profess the Truth. The like I never saw nor knew amongst Friends before thy orders came forth as given forth to keepe Friends in good order (or for the good practices amongst Friends  since they were given forth then before, as the fruites of those that have beene great cryers up and observers of thy orders doe manifest by theire actions, and although formerly thee didst write against those that did differ about outward things an sett up outward things and fall out about outward things, as about days and inventions and traditions,...yett of late Friends have differed very much about such things, and I have not heard nor seene of a long time...[an] Epistle from thee to Friends to exhort them to cease striveinge and fallinge out about such things. Therefore I doe beleive that thee art either an upholder of it or elce doe connive threat [thereat]. And whereas formerly thou didest declare against all those that did proffess the Truth that did keepe on their hatts in the time that Friends did pray (and called it rotten principle of the Ranters etc),...now of late yeares such as are great observers of thy orders are the men that are dayly found in the practice thereof and yett I have not heard that thee hast in the least reproved them for it, and likewise formerly in the yeare 1659 thee didest give out a paper or Booke of Councell and advice to Friends how they should prooceed as to marriage, in which there is noe mention made of Friends goeinge to woemens meettings for theire consent have been judged of a wronge spririt and out of unity with the body of Friends, as if Friends unity stood in the observeinge of outward orders and such things and not in the spirit and Truth, and alsoe it is thy councell in the said paper or booke that nothinge be recorded for money in these things, but freely, but of late I have heard that a Friend did pay for the recordinge of a certificate of his marriage in London, whi[ch] is contrary to thy order and to what was in the begininge practised amongst Friends"; was also written "in thy Booke of Orders...that such as are tale carryeres and raylers whose worke is to sow dessention are to be rep[roved]"; however, has he not been guilty of harkening unto and countenancing "tales carryers and raylers and sowers of dissentions amongst Friends,...for in my heareing when thee wast last at my father [Nathaniel] Cripps, his house, thee didest tell tales ad rayle and revile in a mockeinge, unseemly manner at some Friends in soe much my mother Cripps could not beare it, but reprove[d] thee for it"; also desires to acquaint him "of that which I looke upon as a disorderly pracktice amongst Friends at theire meettings, and that is doe in theire...preachinge and prayinge with the hearers make such a singing and huminge noyse that many times one can scarse understand what is said or spocken, insoemuch that people of the world who doe come to such meettings doe seeme to stand amased at it"; could write much more "of the bad words and actions and wicked fruits that are brought forth by  thy adhearers with the rayleinge, revileinge and fallinge out of Friends in many places and meettings, but shall forbeare at present, desireinge thee and George Whitehead and Alexander Parker to write to Friends generally every where to cease frome these things...which brings a great dishonor to the Truth, and not to judge and condeme one another about th[y] orders, but lett every one be leaft [left] to theire Christian freedome, whether thy...imbrace them or noe, and that...those that doe owne and observe thy orders may not judge and condeme thm that doe not,...nor they that doe not observe them may not judge them that doe,...and  in soe doinge you may put some steppe to those sad and woefull divisions. Otherwise you will manifest that you are not for peace and unity, for of this I am assured, that if Friends were all faithfull to ye light of Christ and Truth of God, and to love one another and to be charitable to the poore without any Directory, prescriptions, rules or orders, for the stricktist orders that were ever given forth by thee or any man upon earth cannot keepe people out of the defilements of the world (without they are guided by the Light and Greace of God), as the fruits of some of those that have beene of thy party have manifested"; as for his query relating to the true certificate, "whether or noe I did give Will[ia]m Rogers licence or authority to print it and spread it abroad, I cannot say certainely whether I did or noe, but of this I am to buy my Tyth[e]e of[f] the impropriators, as I have certified in the certifycate, and therefore I needed not to have sent to thee to know the truth of that, as I was certaine,...but thou hast wronged me, and thyselfe to[o], in sayinge it is false. If thou hadest said as thee didest to me when thee wast last with me at my father Cripps'es... (that thou couldest not remember that thee didest soe advise me), then thee hasest done somthinge like an honest man, and not to have willfully denyed the Truth as in this thee hast cone, and if thy memory have failed thee, blame thy selfe and not me"; hopes that "thee and A[lexander] Parker and G[eorge] Whitehead will answer my desire in writeings to Friends and endevouring to put a stopp to the sad and lamentable divisions amongst Friends"

Contents: [For more on the episode which follows, see William Rogers' The Fifth Part of the Christian Quaker, pp. 83-89]; The meeting was about "a paper of lyes which they and there confederates sent to Thomas Curtis of Reading, and into Westmourland [Westmorland] and into Yorkeshrere [Yorkshire];" the lies were "weh Lucas s[ai]d to G.F. [George Fox] at Henry Sweetings, that there was a marriage", and that one of those to be married said, on standing up, "Master [John] Story, I take such an one to be my wife, and the other stood up and said, Mr. Story, I take such an one to be my husband, and they went afterwards to drinke and eate some cake and cheese and said, 'Sire, I will drinke to thee', and doft his hat, and the other said, 'Thanke you S[i]r', and doft his hat, and where this was done G.F. sent for the woman of the house to know ye truth of it. He asked her whether it was true [and] the woman said it was true [and] it grieved her hart to see it"; N.L. [Nicholas Lucas] claims that "I [George Fox] had said these words aboves[ai]d concerning John Story at H[enry] Sweeting's in hartford [Hertford], and then I told him he was a lyar and he s[ai]d hee had an author for it, but could not remember who it was, and before I came to Swarthmoore [Swarthmoor] H[enry] Sweeting had sent these words into Westmourland and John Story or some of his company sent ym into Yorkshrere, and they were given to Samuel Watson at Settle in Yorkshrere, without a name, and then they tooke it againe and put two letters to it, 'H.S.' without setting down eyther time, town or country from whence it came, and when I came into the north, J[ohn] Story comes to a Friend in Kendal and breakes open a letter and reads it to her, and shee thought the letter had but come to him then, but hearing that it was sent into Yorkshrere before, saw there deceite. Upon this I writ to John Story why he would spread such papers abroad and not first send to mee to know ye truth of ym. likewise I had another of the same papers from Tho[mas] Curtis, which I hearing he had, I sent for, understanding it was...in Barkshrere [Berkshire] and takeawayes, and none of these ever sent to mee till I first sent to them to know the truth of these things, but spread the things behind my backe, and then I did answer and clear my selfe from ye lyes and perversions, and before when i was at Hertford in [16]78, I told...N.L. he was a lyar for affirming such things. Then he said he had an author, but he could not remember him, but since he has brought out ye partyes above mentioned, and tho[mas] Mosse [moss]...weh horrid lyes i did and do deny and the combination of them who are all of a party, both accuser, judg[e] and wittneses and false too", and above 1 1/2 year's since, "there is sent up to Hertford 2 certificates from 2 witnesses who see Anthony Burroughe's [Burrough] put off his hat after the world's customary fasion, wch certificates may be seen at Henry Stoutes [Stout's]"; N.L.'s witnesses however, did not agree, "for one said I mentioned whores and rogues, and the other could not say they heard such words, and as for their saying aforementioned that John Story, I take such a woman to be my wife', and ye woman should say, 'I take such a man to be my husband' and after put of[f] their hats and sid, 'Here is to Mr. Story' as before mentioned, they are all hellish lyes of ye Devill,...for yt marriage which I spoke of was in Glostershiere [Gloucestershire] where I had a meeting about it, and the putting off the hat was concerning Anothony Burroughs in the North according to ye certificates out of ye North, who put off his hatt to some of ye world"; the Lord knows "I spoake these things to them cencerningye danger of youth...in a way of care of youth running out, and H[enry] Sweeting did confes that when I spoake to them I spoake of ye danger of youth running out, by which it may easily be perceived that their sending abroad such lyes and perversions of my words was in enmity, not first sending to me to kno[w] the truth of them"; also as for Tho[mas] Beale's saying, "that I s[ai]d I had set up ye womens meetings and if I should throw them down againe,...they would call me a foole and an asse, or such like words, but they are not like my words, for I said that womens meetings were set up by the power of God, soe they are more lyes and for judgement. Tho[mas] Beale, thy saying this paper of G.F.'s was ye first occasion of division and strife at Hartford,...looke upon ye other side in An[n] Whitehead's letter and thou and you may see there was a division and strife before this paper come among you, and therefore thy words herein was not true and wilt be thy burthen, and I sent to some Friends at Hartford to enquire for them conserning those lyes that were sent up"; [the next paragraph is in a different hand]; "G.F. might as well be misunderstood in his discourse about the disorderly marridg[e] in one place and the loose conversation of one of the 2 men yt came to him at Swarthmore wth Jno. Story at another place yt put off his hatt to some of ye world,...as Nicholes Lucas misunderstood him yesterday when he tould him of his giving him the ly[e] or saying he was a lyer for affirming that there was a wooman, a high shreefe [sheriff] in England, G.F. saying to N.L. 'the ly[e] was first in thy owne mouth', meaning he called him lyer first and N.L. took it that he called him lyer againe" [the original hand then adds, "which had been true enough in ye other matter which G.F. was not speaking of yn"]

Rejoices that the Lord has made him [Stoddard] bold enough to "warne the heades and rulers that they bee noe longer fighters against Him"; there is a great rage in those parts "raised up by meanes of the raileinge preists in their assemblies, and the corrupt magistracies doe winke at the vill doers and suffer our Frends to bee p[er]secuted... in divers places"; when Friends were to meet at Krake [Crayke] "about 8 miles of Yorke [York]"' the priest, hearing that Friends were to meet there, caused the people of th town "to rise up in open rage"' and when someone went to the steeplehouse and tolled the bell, the people were to "rise and beat them [Freinds] out for comeinge into the towne, and the people did rise and me[t] our Frends at the towne end wth greate clubbs and fell uppon them...[and] they feld [felled] Captin Wedle's [Weddall; see number 14] horse,...his wife and hee beinge uppon the backe of him [and] they feld other two of our Frends to the ground and divers others striken"; there was no resistance; Captain [Thomas] Siddall with his wife and many Friends were there, but the people "did com[mmand] them to goe forth of their coasts...and did drive them forth"; therefore the Friends "went to another towne...and did assemble themselves together there to waite uppon the Lord"; John Coale, a Friend, 'was moved to speake much in the cittie in Yorke in the streets to and fro and some of the rude people of the cittie did assemble at night together and broke open the dores att Cornett [Thomas] Denham's in Yorke and sayd they would poole [pull] his wife in peeces for harboringe such a fellowe [John Coale]"; apparently a neighbour came up the backside of the house, pulled a stanchion out of the window and helped her to escape out of the casement "before they broke the dore...but John Coale sat still in the house not beinge made to fear", but he was forcibly taken "out of the house into the streetes" and roughed up, "but hee carried on in patience and made to rejoyce in his suffering"; John Coale "came from London to Yorke"; love to all Friends "wth thee", including John Hodgeson [Hodgson] and Richard Hatter and his wife; "Here is a letter wch came from...George Fox wch hee did desire mee to send...to thee and to deliver it to the Generall [Oliver Cromwell] and heades of the people, to let them have coppies of it. There was one other wch hee sent before. If thou had freedome to have got them printed together and that of mine wch came to thee to bee sent to Generall [Oliver] Crombwell [Cromwell] wth that of Richard Farnesworth's [Farnworth's; this ma be referring to Farnworth's The Generall Good to all People ; Wing F483 in which is included Aldam's An Exhortation to the Magistrates] to gett them all printed in booke, or gett these two of George's [possibly And a Warning to the Rulers of England which is included in James Naylor's A Lamentacion (by one...). ; Wing N292] printed together and let mee recieve some of them as shortly as can bee or write backe to mee whether it bee thy freedom to medle wth them or noe in gettinge them printed"; Friends salute him and are in health; "Truth doth abundantly breake forth in divers places"

Is present with him “in the dear felowship of the gospell of Xt [Christ], wch He hath committed to us to publish abrode to the nations”; since coming out of “the Easteren [Eastern] partes, I have been about 10 dayes near about Kendall [Kendal], whear hath been a great noyse and busling in people’s minds about thees stirs, but noe action. Anthony Pearson hath been much about Kendall being one of the Comisioners for the Militia and would have raysed the cuntrie but all the Justises and comisioners wear so backeward they would not nedle, se[e]ing their comision was take[n] att Warington [Warrington] by the Black Band, the Prests party, but rather in their judgment, they adheere, if they durst bee sene, with the Prests party. I was not with A.P. [Anthony Pearson] in thees partes, least itt should be sayd in some thing[s] I sought my selfe to be advanced in sume publick afayers [affaires] which hath been  sayd by divers of me, although without ground or cause att all, and so I forbore, being… dead to those things of the stir Lanchishire [Lancashire] and Cheschire [Cheshire] [i.e. the rebellion led by Sir George Booth in favour of the restoration of Charles Stuart]. I beleve thou will hear befor[e] I can give the[e] any certa[i]n relation, only they are the worst of men in those partes and some other[s] who flocke to them, being about the number of a thousand att the most. W. Cole [probably William Cole, Vicar of Preston], is one among them with a great number of prests more, about 100, but now they draw of[f] seeing the insurect[i]on is stoped in the rest of the nation. They are somewhat dubious what the end will bee. All or most of the prests in Westermorland have had inteligenc[e] from them, but dare not goe, but rather leave it to see how the businesse began will end befor[e] they goe to[o] far. Itt broke of[f] the Asisses att Apelby [Appleby] for the present, but yett the Judges [Francis Thorpe and John Parker] returne this we[e]ke to keep them. They ar[e] very moderate in all things and easy to be intreated. I can[n]ott… say but I may be att the Assises att Abelby [Appleby]. I have no heard from the[e] since I was at Richmond, by reason Lanckshire [Lancashire] post hath been interopted this pretty while. Ne[i]ther have I writen unto the[e] since I was at Durham. Freinds heare are quiatt and medells in none of thees things but all is p[re]tiouse and lovely, only G[eorge] Taylor is a bad man and gives great occation of dishonoring the Treuth and I am afrayd will break out into open prohanesse and must be denied by all. Forbeare writing to him att all more or lesse, nether sufer and [any] to send a letter to him that thou can help, but derect them to Thimas Willian. Mor[e] of him thou will heare. I was att Kendall [Kendal] metting yesterday, being the First day. This we[e]ke I intend to car[r]y my boy to Thomas Lawson to scho[o]le into the furhter parte of the county and may stay a few days. The post comes now Lanchishire way… Thou may write and I beleve the obstructions which hinders will sone be removed”; love to G.F. [George Fox] “and to Geratt [Gerard Roberts] and all Freinds in and about the City [London]. This monring newes is come to this towne that the enimy is disipated about Nantwach [Nantwich] and Northwatch [Northwich] the last 6 day. The newes I suposse thou will have more cert[i]n and so[o]ner, so I forbeare. This morning I mett with John Fawcett who tells me a writt was come downe for me and almost runn to any outla[w]ry about the ould businesse att Apelby for fees to the Clarke of Assise. What they will doe in it I know not. Further thou may heare”

“Before thy letter came to me I was gone forth and have not beene negligent since my comeinge from thee, and have not beene 3 or 4 dayes at most at home.

Research Notes: NNR 11/2023: 
The year for this letter is in question because there are three listed years in the calendar with one month and day. The conclusion drawn was that there was originally no year date on the letter and was given a year when endorsed [potentially by George Fox] so, Horle then in brackets explains that it is probable that the year would be 1654/5 instead of 1653. Since the letter was written in the 11 month that would push the modern date into 1655 of January hence why it is labeled as such here.

Rejoices in the fact “that I was heare (though by it I have lost my liberty) to testifie sumthing of the Trueth of God”; have had “good liberty of spech and good audience beffor the judges and the great men of the cuntrie and the whole cuntrie”; “I shall give you a shorte acounte of the prosedings at Apellby [Appleby] as relating to us and Trueth”; on coming to the town “I…immediately went to the clarke of the asise beffor the judges [the judges on this circuit at that date were Sir Thomas Twisden and Sir Christopher Turnor] came in and tould him I was come not knowing wether they expected my apear[e]n[c]e or not. He tould me I did very well and sayd he would aquent the judges, and withall tould me the judges had heard of me att London. I sayd, ‘nothing but well I hope’, and he sayd ‘noe’, he would only aquent them, and so I should ingage to apear the next assise to my indittment [indictment] and I should not apear in courte. I bid him doe what he would and if it was so, I should quickly goe out of the town, for I had noe other ocation”; nonetheless it was still “in me [that] I must apear publickly in courte. iIn the mean time [Sir] Philip Musgrove [Musgrave] informed the judges of me and that I was a person dangerous and a ringleader and the like and keept up publick metings of dangerious consequence destructive to the peace of the nation, so they concluded I should apear in court and so the clerke indormed me and tould me about what time I should be caled, so they began the courte and the judge [Sir Thomas Twisden] gave his charge to the grand jurey in wch he sayd, their was a sorte of people who under pretence of conscience and relig[i]on…se[e]med to build upon the King’s Declaration from Brada [Breda] and under the coulour of this hatched rebelions, treasons and the like, and gave the grand jurey charge to make inquery of them for the presorvation of the peace of the nation”; they then impannelled the juries “and brought out four to the barr and inditted them of high treason, and in the midest of this the[y] caled me to the barr, and the judge spoke calmely to me and tould me, the dace of things was altered now since the last asisse, and made a large spech to me and the cuntrie, telling me that in all sectes under pretence of conscience, did violate the lawes and acted treasons and rebelions, as was manifest, not that he had anything to acuse me of, vut seing the oath of Alegence [Allegienace] was tendered me and I refused it, it was lo[o]ked upon that such persons wear enimes to the King [Charles II] and government, and tould me they would not trouble me to answer my inditement now, but only to apear to itt the next assise [ans] in the meantime to enter in recognisance for good behaviour, unto wch I desired in me[e]knese, liberty of spech [speech] and audience, wch I had very larg[e]ly wthout interuption, and sayd to Judg[e] Twisdan [Twisden], ‘Thou knowes very well upon a slender…account I was brought beffor the[e] the last assise wheirin thou was pleased to tender me the othe [oath] of Aleigance though I believe both thou and the wholle court knew it was receved principall amongst us not to swear att all. Many reasons I gave the[e] then and more I have to give, of I may be h[e]ard, for it may seme an absurd thing to you that I should refuse it, if I doe not give reasons, wheirfor[e] I did give divers then ans now more I might add’, which I had a pretty time to declare in, and tould the jury I was none of those that made religion a cloake of malitiousnesse, nor conscience a cloke to car[r]y on plotts or conspirisies,…and seing I was ingage[d] to apear att the a[ss]isse next, I desired the judge that noe further thing might be required of me”; however “he tould me I must…enter in bond for good behaviour in this dangerious time, and wished [me to] consider of it and tell them then or beffor the asisse broke up, I could then but I rather deffered my positivve answer one day or tow [two]”; then on the second day “they caled me agayne” after having indicted 3 others “upon the account of high treason, and the judge began agayne with [a] long spe[e]ch about treason and rebelion and tould the cuntrie all these things was caried on under prettence…[of] religion, and amongst the rest acused the Quackers”; waited till he had finished and them “I tould him, as to those I was clear and I hoped the courte noe cuntrie hath nothing to lay my charge my selfe with all, for I loved peace and sought with all men, and tould him, seing he was pleased to lett me answer to my inditment the next assise that I was willing and I had been of good behaviour and should be, but i[t] semed to me a hard hing seing I was ableiged to answer to an inditment of that consortment if prosecuted agaynst me as extended the losse of my liberty for liffe and my estate for ever, I hoped the courte did not envive my liberty for so litle a time as 5 months, but still the judge presed and the other judg[e] [Sir Christopher Turnor] also that they did not desire my restraynt if I would enter in bond on this account, but because I putt on the thing as far as I could, I heard Danyall [Daniel] Phleming [Fleming] had another inditment ready agaynst me about metting and stood up and sayd to the judg[e], ‘My Lord, he is a great speaker and the Quackers canott spar[e] him'. The Judg[e] answered, ‘Lett him be what he will. If he will enter this bond he shall have his liberty’. The[n] Judg[e] Turner stode up and sayd, ‘What doe you talke of sonscience. We medle not with your conscience, but you keep up great mettings and goes not to the church’. I tould him we wear falen into a sad age if meting togither in a peacable maner in the feare of God, without armes or force or intention of hiorte [hurt] to any man, only to exorte one another and to be steadfast in the fayth and to walke in rightiousnesse and to pray tog[et]her in the holy ghost as the primitive Christians did of ould that this should be recken[e]d as breach of peace and misbehaviour. Futher I tould them itt was a reseav[e]d principall among[s]t us that Christ[‘s] Kingdome must not nor could not be sett up by forc[e] of carnall weapons, and we wear come unto the Prince of Peace and could not learn war any more, but could love our enimies and…if I had 20 lives I durst ingage them all for the body if Quacker[s] for ever having any hand in war or things of that natur[e], for all such as wear found in anything of that natur[e] I did disowne them. Nay furhter, I sayd if their wear any such they wear not of us. With that Philipe Musgrove [Musgrave] stode up and sayd, ‘My Lord, what as this gentellman hath sayd cannot be treue, for we find by experience in this last plott [known by various names- Kaber Rigg, Farnley Wood, the Northern Plot, etc] them to be the only inteligencers from all partes of the nation’, and further sayd, ‘My Lord, we have put them in preson once and agay[n] and fined them ans yett they still p[er]siste and as soone as they gitt oute metts agayne’. Also [Sir] John Louther [Lowther], the elder…stode up and sayd, ‘My Lord, they grow insolent and notwithstanding all lawes and the seveir [severe] exec[u]tion of them, yett the[y] grown upon us and their metings are dangerious as we se[e] by this sad effecte’. With that Philip Musgrove puled out a paper in greatt capitall letters. I beleve it was thy hand, G.F. [George Fox], for I knew it att a good distance”; was handed to the judge who in turn handed it to the clark and it was passed from one to anpther and read, but not aloud; “With that Phleming [Fleming] stode and tould them he had writen to his bro[ther] [Colonel William Fleming?] and some other Justis [Justice] who still did mette in another county to apr[e]hend them and send them to Lancaster, amon[g]st which one died [apparently Samuel Sandys; see Besse, II, 12] and they brought his body through the cuntrie and the Quackers sett this paper [for the paper, see Besse, II, 12] on his corpse. So all these things mett togither in one and came agaynst me”; nonetheless, “I sayd, ‘notwithstanding hear hath been diligent inqueary by the grand jurey and the cuntrie about this plott, yett whatt had they found agaysnt the Quackers’? Philipe Musrouge [Musgrave] tould me of one [Reginald] Fawcett that brought intelligence from the county of Durham and some from Leeds to Cap[tain] [Robert] Akinson [Atkinson]. I tould him, ‘Fawcett we had not owned this 6 years, and though p[er]adventure he or any other in this county or else wheir to reputted should be brought under conviction of guilt by the law and p[er]adventer suffer acording to the law, yett did believe any or all of such, if any such weare, that they would testeiffe [testify] for us though agayn[st] themselves [and] that the body of Freinds ans mettings every wheir did not owne them in it’, and theirfor[e] [I] desired the Judg[e] not represent us so hardly to the cuntrie, for God was with us and on our side,…[and] att last the judge sayd he and the gentellmen had spent much time with me and he would discourse noe more, so I tould him I should be shorte also and not trouble them more, that I was willing to apeare to my inditment att the asisses and to live in peace and quitnesse [quietness]… if that would sattusfie them, but I must enter in bond or noe liberty, so then I tould them, if I should doe so I wear trechorious to God and to my owne conscience and they would lo[o]ke upon me as an hipocritte, so I tould them I could not doe it, and so bad[e] the goaler, ‘Take him away’, and when I was going, I sayd, ‘The fear of God be amongst [you]’, and the judge bad[e] him lett me alone, if I would say anymore, but I was swe[e]ttely clear”; there were near “12 young men brought to prison the we[e]ke beffor[e] for the meting, but none caled, but my selfe [and] the justises tendered them liberty on the same acount if they would enter in bond for good behav[i]our, and… I se[e] they will make their generall rule everywheir to breake the metings as they judge. Hear was 4 condemned, 3 executed and one reprived [reprieved], and all those proved agaynst them, ao they are att liberty upon bond to apeare att the asise”; love to M.F. [Margaret Fell] “and all the prisoners”; has not had “p[er]fecte knowledg[e] of their prosedings with you”; (Postscript on side 4- “By accedent, I se[e] an account of the assises drawn up by Philip Mus[g]rove which was sent by the post to the King, and so I believe will come in the News Booke to doe us harme. The thing was this- decalring about the plott, 2 young men, he sayth, came from Leeds that wear Quackers and gave intellegence to Cap[tain] Atkinson. The evidence in courte was thise- that tow [two] young men that wear strangers came to Captain Akinson [Atkinson]. The[y] asked what they wear and the evidence sayd, he knew not, they wear sober men, and Philip hath putt it in ‘Quackers’. We tould some of the justises of it and tould them it was erong and they wronged us and one sayd, Philip Musgrove did it, and so putt it off themselves, and thus they invent mischeife ever[y] way agaynst us, but the Lord id on our side”)

For my dear Father George Fox and my Dear Friends George Whitehead and Alexander Parker,
this in London

Contents:
[The letter begins on the second side of number 49 and ends on the second side of number 48];
They are honourable in the Lord not only among those with whom they are outwardly present
“but even in the Ilands afarre of[f]”; Friends have lovingly accepted “your comfortable advice
and tender reprofe where things are amise [see number 46], the effects whereof hath been
manifested in your severall epistles to Freinds in this place [Barbados], one of wch I lately
rec[eive]d, being an answer to a paper given forth by ou[r] Quarterly Meeting [on the 23 rd of the
10 th month [December], 1680] to wch mine and my wive’s [Margaret nee Fell] names were and
some others [in all, 82 signatories], but nit with a full sonsent, for though we were very much
burdened in ourselves while many...did very much stand up for it, and judging yt diverse were
there...who subscribed to the paper who were farre from submitting to the judment of the spirit of
Truth either in themselves or others, for fear of hindering them from that submission yt might be
of generall benefit, I put my hand and my wife suffered her name to be put to the paper”;
although the intent of Friends was good, “the paper was very ill worded considering w[ha]t
hands it hath come unto, for the day before the Quarterly Meeting was, we got one if Thomas
Crispe’s [Crisp’s] booke[s] wherein the paper was printed [Babel’s Builders Unmasking
Themselves; see numbers 46-47] with your answer to it”, which though it might do hurt in some
other places, might in fact “moderate the spirits of some who otherwise might have been more
rigid. It [Fox’s answer] was read in the open Quarterly meeting and your judgm[en]t freely
submitted to and ordered yt the Quarterly meeting paper should be taken out of the booke and
your answer put in the place of it”; there were diverse there [at the Quarterly meeting] who did
not usually attend, but now did so “to hear your answer read and to vent themselves upon it, wch
they did after a large manner and very ill becoming such a metting. John Weale moved yt Friends
should give forth a letter of condemnation of it, wch should be spread among the world, for he
said it had dome more hurt then wither James Naylour [Nayler] or John Perrot,...and Oliver
Hooton had drawne up some reasons why he could not signe the paper, wch he had written soon
after going forth of the paper wch some Freinds were appointed to overlooke before it was
publickly read, and they finding that the reading of it would rather doe hurt then good and yt the
occation for wch it was written was over, desiring him to let it alone, wch he consenting to, did

very much abate the heat in severall. Though I was not well satisfied with the writing if the paper
nor in setting my hand to it, yet finding yt severall in a wrong spirit would seem to joyne with
you in judging the paper and yet would trample upon Freinds, wch forced me to keep the closer
to Freinds yt they might not be quite overborne and a paper of condemnation being urged, it was
asked whether you were not full in your answer, and if such thing had been needfull whether yee
would not have advised Freinds to it, and you not advising to such a thing, Freinds did not
yeild”; there are several who do not attend the Quarterly meeting or any other meeting except
“upon such occasions as this”; in fact “when your epistle with W[illia]m Gibson[‘s] and James
Parke’s was brought to a meeting for mixt people, there were some who had not been ... at such a
meeting for neer two years, and though I doe understand the blame of not reading the Epistle at
yt time was laid upon Ralph Fretwell and myselfe, yet there was such a dispute before we came
into the meeting yt I wondered what was the matter, not having heard Freinds so high since I
came last unto the country, and w[ha]t I did was by way of endeavouring to moderate, for after
much time was spent and Freinds understood yt Christopher Newham would have brought it to
the six weekes meeting a fortnight before, but was perswaded to the contrary wherin [it]
[ap]peared, though the letter was not directed to any meeting more yn [an]other, yet yt wch was
intended was, as there was something of re[proof] and caution, to make it as publick as might be,
wch I know was not intended by the writers, and because I said, upon reading 4 or 5 lines of the
begining, finding differences and controversies mentioned, yt I did not looke upon yt [the
meeting of mixed people] [as] a fit meeting to read it in, and my words were presently perverted
thus, yt I did not looke upon the letter [as] fir to be read in that meeting”; meant no such thing,
“but in regard there were diverse boyes and young raw and unsetled people, I did not looke upon
it soe fit an oooprtunitie of reading it”; it was however afterwards read twice at a six week’s
meeting “in the same place, where the women came to the men on purpose” and it was “very
well reveived”; in order that things might be well understood, “we got a meeting with severall
masters of the ships where things were mildly and cooly discoursed, and they seemed to be well
satisfied”; thus hoped to have heard no more of it but have heard that there “hath been a
complaining in England, as if the love of Freinds who writ yt letter [i.e. Fox, Parker and
Whitehead] had been very much slighted because it was not...read at that unseasonable time”;
understands this by two letters, or else would not have mentioned “one word of it, for I know
these things cannot be pleasant to you to hear”; at the last Six Week’s Meeting, John Weale “with
severall others were there” and words were exchanged between two Friends at which point John
Weale “brings out you Epistle and desired it might be read, wch though not altogether in season,
Freinds being then on otherbusines, wch tooke ym up a considerable time in debating, yet yt noe
offence might be taken and Freinds were desired to take good notice of the advice in it, it being
very wholesome and good, but in reading over the coppie yt John Weale brought, we found in
one place ‘aposles of the Lord’ instead of ‘a people of the Lord’ wch was a mistake Richard Ford
saw in a coppie of it wch some apostates had gotten, in wch also was a worse mistake, for
instead of ‘keep out all discord’, it was in theirs ‘keep out all concord’”; fears that several “of the
Apostates...doe endeavour to get soppies [of] all particular epistles, wch are of particular service”
and rejoice when there is anything of reproof to Friends in them, even when given with love and
tenderness; therefore, desires that “when there is occasion to send over any epistles, if you know
not of any fit here to send them to, that they may be [one word is torn out here] by such as are of

a right gospell spirit and not make a bad use of that w[ch] is intended for the generall good of
Friends”; there are also some [epistles] “wch both come over here and also give intelligence
fro[m] London of whatsoever is spoken though privately yt may reflect upon Fr[iends] in
generall or in any particular, wch very much gratifies those yt are...filled with prejudice already,
and John Weale in the Quarterly Meeting told Freinds yt a good Friend in England said the paper
was witchcraft, and Walter Benthall who went about a little to mend it said, he said yt it must
needs to have a spirit of witchcraft with it or else soe many simple people would not have been
bewitched to set their hands to it”; Thomas Parker “sent over Thomas Crispe’s [Crisp’s] booke to
his son in law who was a little before his going hence married to his [parker’s] daughter by a
preist (and he was...to give it to Edward Hunt who holds a correspondencie with the apostates
and by whose meanes it hath come to be dispersed as it hath been)”; would be glad if “this bitter
root of prejudice were quite rooted out from among us” because most of the time in meetings
“the passage of life is stopt, and Mary Weale, who sometimes speakes [a] few words in meetings,
will run out in prejudice, soe yt she is of[ten] times almost choaked”; one time, at a general
meeting “where many of the world were, after many good testimonies,...she stood up and said,
‘he yt dips his hand in the dish with me is the same yt shall betray me. Freinds, looke to it. You
are all oncerned’”; Richard Ford, by praying, atopped her, “wch John Weale tooke such offence
at yt privately asking me what I thought of Richard Ford’s soe doing, I said I feared if he had not
done soe, it might have been worse, wch John called the very quintessence of enmitie. Freinds
have used many endeavours to gaine John Weale and are willing to passe by and forget all that is
past and if anything atill rests yt cannot be buried and forgiven, to discourse it in coolnes. I have
much laboured with him diverse times...but as yet I doe not see yt anything doth prevaile”;
Friends desired to speak with his wife [Mary Weale?] and Thomas Clark and thus invited them
“to a meeting of Freinds in the ministry”; John Weale came along with them and there was much
moderate discourse, first with Thomas Clark who was persuaded “to refraine his frequent going
to Allice Lear, formerly Alice Butcher, who is in great opposition to Freinds, and Freinds fear his
going thither and not being soe wise as he should be is both a hurt to her and himselfe”; however
John Weale told Friends “yt a Friend told him yt he heard George Fox say yt he did well in
visiting her, wch if Freinds were sencible was for either of their good, they would not be agst, but
they have cause to fear the contrary, seeing they are very friendly and familier, and yet she hath
an utter enmitie agst all other Freinds and would not soe much as speake with ot see diverse
Freinds though they have gone many miles in the love of God to visit her”; acquaints them with
all this so that they can remedy the same “for we have found by experience...yt Epistles from you
who are Elders have been of great sevice here”; notes the “great deadnes and dulnes yt hath been
in our meetings in generall even when the best of Freinds amongst us have been gathered
together”; probably due to want of love and therefore “the only remedie wilbe a promoting of
love in generall”; thus, “it was upon me to propound...to the meeting of Freinds on the ministry
that differences and strifes may be wholy laid asid[e] and all yt had ought agst another might
forgive one another...wch at present is under the consideration of that meeting” and from them it
will go to the Quarterly and six week’s meetings “and from thence to the particular monthly
meetings, and from thence to the particular, even the apostates themselves”; those who reject it
will remain excluded; as to the meetings, “I thinke it necessarie to give you an acc[oun]t yt when
yee write any Epistles you may direct them to those meetings you would have them read at, and
then there wilbe noe controversie but you directions followed”; there are four Quarterly meetings
and are held at the houses of four Friends for three days, two of which are for meetings of
worship and the third is for business; unfortunately “we cannot yet bring them to there full
service, because divers intrude who are not fit to be at such meetings”; believes that it shouldbe
ordered “yt none should come to quarterly meetings but such as are wither chosen or well
apporved of by the particular meetings, but some Freinds, fearing it may give severall offence
have not yeilded to it” and therefore, much necessary business is waved and sometimes “weake
Freinds hear disputes wch are not for their benefit”; there are also between every Wuartetly
meeting, two general monthly meetings “at the Bridge Towne [Bridgetown], wch continues to
daies, the first day of wch...used to be for busines” and until they were altered were “great
meetings of contention” but now the men and women meet apart for “about two or three hours”
and if any general epistle should come relating to doctrine, it is read “and ordered how to be
dispersed among Freinds and a collection made”; then the men and women go into the public
meeting “and there have a meeting of worship”; marraiges are sometimes brought to the men and
womens meeting “after they have passes the particular meetings”; because little comes to that
meeting “wch may admit disputes, there are invited toit young convinced Freinds and Freinds
children who are growing towards yea[re] of discretion, and since meetings have been thus
altered, they have been very peacable though some who consented to the altering of them are not
now well pleased with ym”; on the morning of the second day of the general meeting. “Freinds
in the ministry meet for the supplying of the first daie’s meeting for a fortnight, and afterwards
there is a publick meeting for worship”; between the general and Quarterly meetings, “we have a
meeting on the 3d day of the weeke, where in the morning Freinds in the ministry meet and
where things are treated of in relation to the publick service of Truth, but soe many presse on us
yt often times we cannot speake to things necessarie”; after that meeting, “there is a publick
meeting for worship, where are most of Freinds in the ministry in the Iland [island]” bit with so
many coming a great way and with time being short, “we are streightened” and cannot get
through necessary things, and therefore they “were glad...of thy [George Fox] advice to have yt
meeting on the second day, wch we have not had time yet to settle”; there are also six week’s
meetings which answer the business of the six week’s meeting at London “and to these meetings
we would willingly have none come but established Freinds, such as are sound in their minds
and judgm[en]ts and fr[ee] from contention, though we cannot alwaies have it soe”; since there
are 6 divisions, “we have in every division a particular monthly meeting to ech all yt are
convinced and walke honestly doe come”, while on first days, “we have 5 or 6 publick meetings
the supply of which is taken care of at meetings of Friends in the ministry “wch doe soe fall in
turnes yt on[ce] in 5 weekes there is a publick meeting on first daies to wch any yt des[ire] may
come in any part of the Iland [island]”; for the further information of Friends, “I doe intend to
send my brother [William] Meade a plat of ye Iland with the severall division lines drawne in it
and an acc[oun]t of all ...meetings in the Iland, wch may be ready for Freinds information when
ever there is occasion”; hope they can give assistance “yt the unseemly practice of contention
wch...may well be tearmed a custome, may bee [en]ded from amongst us”

instead of ‘keep out all discord’, it was in theirs ‘keep out all concord’”; fears that several “of the
Apostates...doe endeavour to get soppies [of] all particular epistles, wch are of particular service”
and rejoice when there is anything of reproof to Friends in them, even when given with love and
tenderness; therefore, desires that “when there is occasion to send over any epistles, if you know
not of any fit here to send them to, that they may be [one word is torn out here] by such as are of

a right gospell spirit and not make a bad use of that w[ch] is intended for the generall good of
Friends”; there are also some [epistles] “wch both come over here and also give intelligence
fro[m] London of whatsoever is spoken though privately yt may reflect upon Fr[iends] in
generall or in any particular, wch very much gratifies those yt are...filled with prejudice already,
and John Weale in the Quarterly Meeting told Freinds yt a good Friend in England said the paper
was witchcraft, and Walter Benthall who went about a little to mend it said, he said yt it must
needs to have a spirit of witchcraft with it or else soe many simple people would not have been
bewitched to set their hands to it”; Thomas Parker “sent over Thomas Crispe’s [Crisp’s] booke to
his son in law who was a little before his going hence married to his [parker’s] daughter by a
preist (and he was...to give it to Edward Hunt who holds a correspondencie with the apostates
and by whose meanes it hath come to be dispersed as it hath been)”; would be glad if “this bitter
root of prejudice were quite rooted out from among us” because most of the time in meetings
“the passage of life is stopt, and Mary Weale, who sometimes speakes [a] few words in meetings,
will run out in prejudice, soe yt she is of[ten] times almost choaked”; one time, at a general
meeting “where many of the world were, after many good testimonies,...she stood up and said,
‘he yt dips his hand in the dish with me is the same yt shall betray me. Freinds, looke to it. You
are all oncerned’”; Richard Ford, by praying, atopped her, “wch John Weale tooke such offence
at yt privately asking me what I thought of Richard Ford’s soe doing, I said I feared if he had not
done soe, it might have been worse, wch John called the very quintessence of enmitie. Freinds
have used many endeavours to gaine John Weale and are willing to passe by and forget all that is
past and if anything atill rests yt cannot be buried and forgiven, to discourse it in coolnes. I have
much laboured with him diverse times...but as yet I doe not see yt anything doth prevaile”;
Friends desired to speak with his wife [Mary Weale?] and Thomas Clark and thus invited them
“to a meeting of Freinds in the ministry”; John Weale came along with them and there was much
moderate discourse, first with Thomas Clark who was persuaded “to refraine his frequent going
to Allice Lear, formerly Alice Butcher, who is in great opposition to Freinds, and Freinds fear his
going thither and not being soe wise as he should be is both a hurt to her and himselfe”; however
John Weale told Friends “yt a Friend told him yt he heard George Fox say yt he did well in
visiting her, wch if Freinds were sencible was for either of their good, they would not be agst, but
they have cause to fear the contrary, seeing they are very friendly and familier, and yet she hath
an utter enmitie agst all other Freinds and would not soe much as speake with ot see diverse
Freinds though they have gone many miles in the love of God to visit her”; acquaints them with
all this so that they can remedy the same “for we have found by experience...yt Epistles from you
who are Elders have been of great sevice here”; notes the “great deadnes and dulnes yt hath been
in our meetings in generall even when the best of Freinds amongst us have been gathered
together”; probably due to want of love and therefore “the only remedie wilbe a promoting of
love in generall”; thus, “it was upon me to propound...to the meeting of Freinds on the ministry
that differences and strifes may be wholy laid asid[e] and all yt had ought agst another might
forgive one another...wch at present is under the consideration of that meeting” and from them it
will go to the Quarterly and six week’s meetings “and from thence to the particular monthly
meetings, and from thence to the particular, even the apostates themselves”; those who reject it
will remain excluded; as to the meetings, “I thinke it necessarie to give you an acc[oun]t yt when
yee write any Epistles you may direct them to those meetings you would have them read at, and

then there wilbe noe controversie but you directions followed”; there are four Quarterly meetings
and are held at the houses of four Friends for three days, two of which are for meetings of
worship and the third is for business; unfortunately “we cannot yet bring them to there full
service, because divers intrude who are not fit to be at such meetings”; believes that it shouldbe
ordered “yt none should come to quarterly meetings but such as are wither chosen or well
apporved of by the particular meetings, but some Freinds, fearing it may give severall offence
have not yeilded to it” and therefore, much necessary business is waved and sometimes “weake
Freinds hear disputes wch are not for their benefit”; there are also between every Wuartetly
meeting, two general monthly meetings “at the Bridge Towne [Bridgetown], wch continues to
daies, the first day of wch...used to be for busines” and until they were altered were “great
meetings of contention” but now the men and women meet apart for “about two or three hours”
and if any general epistle should come relating to doctrine, it is read “and ordered how to be
dispersed among Freinds and a collection made”; then the men and women go into the public
meeting “and there have a meeting of worship”; marraiges are sometimes brought to the men and
womens meeting “after they have passes the particular meetings”; because little comes to that
meeting “wch may admit disputes, there are invited toit young convinced Freinds and Freinds
children who are growing towards yea[re] of discretion, and since meetings have been thus
altered, they have been very peacable though some who consented to the altering of them are not
now well pleased with ym”; on the morning of the second day of the general meeting. “Freinds
in the ministry meet for the supplying of the first daie’s meeting for a fortnight, and afterwards
there is a publick meeting for worship”; between the general and Quarterly meetings, “we have a
meeting on the 3d day of the weeke, where in the morning Freinds in the ministry meet and
where things are treated of in relation to the publick service of Truth, but soe many presse on us
yt often times we cannot speake to things necessarie”; after that meeting, “there is a publick
meeting for worship, where are most of Freinds in the ministry in the Iland [island]” bit with so
many coming a great way and with time being short, “we are streightened” and cannot get
through necessary things, and therefore they “were glad...of thy [George Fox] advice to have yt
meeting on the second day, wch we have not had time yet to settle”; there are also six week’s
meetings which answer the business of the six week’s meeting at London “and to these meetings
we would willingly have none come but established Freinds, such as are sound in their minds
and judgm[en]ts and fr[ee] from contention, though we cannot alwaies have it soe”; since there
are 6 divisions, “we have in every division a particular monthly meeting to ech all yt are
convinced and walke honestly doe come”, while on first days, “we have 5 or 6 publick meetings
the supply of which is taken care of at meetings of Friends in the ministry “wch doe soe fall in
turnes yt on[ce] in 5 weekes there is a publick meeting on first daies to wch any yt des[ire] may
come in any part of the Iland [island]”; for the further information of Friends, “I doe intend to
send my brother [William] Meade a plat of ye Iland with the severall division lines drawne in it
and an acc[oun]t of all ...meetings in the Iland, wch may be ready for Freinds information when
ever there is occasion”; hope they can give assistance “yt the unseemly practice of contention
wch...may well be tearmed a custome, may bee [en]ded from amongst us”

Wee at present have peace wth all ye nations of ye indians, and the great fatt King of ye Tuskiroroes [Tuscaroras] was not long since with me having had an indian slaine in these partes” and having been informed “it was by the English”; however, on inquiry, “I found out ye murtherer…was a Chewan [Chowan] indian, on of their great men’s sons, whom I i[m]ediately order[e]d to bee apprehended, but ye Chewan indians bought his life of ye Tuskiroroes King for a great quantity of Wamp[um] and peage.

This Tuskiroroe King seems to bee a very wise man as to naturall parts. Some of ye indians neare mee are so civilized as to come into English habits and have cattle of their owne, and I looke upon their outward civilizing as a good preparation for ye Gospell”; only wish that “all yt had knowne itt had been faithfull”; for God “forsakes none butt the unfaithfull”; “what I writt unto yee in my former I can[n]ot butt againe repeat wch is a desire to bee had in remembrance by yee, having a faith in ye power yt was by yee in this last age of ye world first preached and convinced mee in ye beginning and separated mee from my father’s house”; wishes that “these partes had binn more visited by Friends…[but] ye im[m]ediate sence and growth of ye divine Seed is encouragement to all yt witness the same”; (Postscript- sends love to Friends and to Geo[rge] Keith “whose booke of ye way to ye citty of God [The Way to the city of God described (1687); Wing K235] hath binn very serviceable unto mee”; love to Geo[rge] Whitehead and William Meade)

Asks what honour “can it be to Coll[onel Robert] Bennett [Bennet] and Migor [probably Major, rather than Mayor] [Peter] Ceely to wronge men and cast them into prison who are Freinds to ye Commonwelth of Isarell [Israel]? What have wee done or what evill is in our hands that always sought ye good and not ye hurt of England’s Commonwealth for two great men of ye county that have been both swords and spears to defend themselv[e]s to appeare against a cupple of nacked lads [Joseph Coale and William Salt] without either sword or staff, or a company of naked people that goe forth in ye name or ye Lord and have nothing by ye arme of ye Lord, ye armor of Light to defend them, that perswad[e] men to be reconsiled unto God that soe they may be reconsiled one to another, and soe come to beat their swords and plow shears and their spears into pruning hokes and come to leave of[f] to learne ware any more, and because they doe not handle carnall waepons nor none hath ought ot accuse them of any such things, yett if they will not promise they will not use any carnall waepon, nor asa[u]lt any mans person, they are not to be sufered, saiest thou, but must be restrained of their liberty”; asls whether it has appeared “to any many that any of us whom ye world in scorne call Qaukers have offered violence to any man”; in fact, “have we not bine ye men almost ever seince we came into this county [Cornwall], where thy selfe Peeter Ceely are Governers, that have received violence and injurie, that have undergon[e] false accusations and slanders wherein the peace of ye Commonwealth hath bine broken and ye Lawes of ye nation infringed? But where is ye sowrd all this while that should be a terror to ye evill doer and have bine for ye praise of them that doe well?”; wonders if it is “your way to requite us for laboureing to bring people from un[d]er ye power of ye magistrat[e]s sword, for exhorting all to consider their ways and to bring them to ye sober life”; also, “Hast thou not owned Peeter Ceely’s act in sending us to prison and taken ye burden of[f] his shoulders and put it upon thy owne, and soe made thy selfe one with him? We were his prisoners beofer and now hast thou not made us thine?”; and as if “we had not bine suficiently wronged before, thou thyselfe… [said] we refuse to be peacable in ye countrey. Is that thy way to right us, no man having to accuse us of ye break of the peace, when we declared that we had peacable intentions according to thy question, that we wished peace to all, sought ye peace of all and indevered it, and dust thou call this a refusing, as is expresed in thy callinder, because we cannot come under bonds or ingagements? Dust thou therefore say to render us odious, that we refuse peaceablenes?”; must wait for wisdom from the Lord; (Lengthy postcript- asks what “couldest thou have done to us more then thou hast done in sending us againe to prison if we were ye greatest enimies to ye Commonwealth? Are we not dealt with heare worse then Caveleers, for where are any of them in you prisons, or any of them cast into prison and brought forth afterward to give bond that they will be peaceable men?” after all, “we have had no accusers come against us to prove us disturbers of ye peace, but on ye contreary, one of your selves [justice James Lance] that sate our judges, said of one [William Salt] of us [that] he though he intended no disturbance”; since there was no accuser, “hast thou not sate thy selfe as Judge, accuser and condemner, all at once and is this according to your owne law to condeme persons to prison without hearing theire accusers or signifiing any crime laid against them?”; would like to know “what ofence hath there appeared to thee in either of us… worthy of these bonds or imprisonment,… but ought we not rather to have bine quit by Proclaimmation according to your owne law”; they are known “to severall in authority in this Com[m]onwe[a]lth to have bine them that have always[s] sought ye peace thereof and never before were accused to be ye trublers of it (nor restrained for soe doeing) or refusing to live peacablly, before we met with thee,… and are not they ye greatest Freinds to a Commonwelth that labouers to bring people from under the curse that soe they may come to be pertakers of the blesinge where treu peace and rest is injoyed, that ye world can neither give nor take away?”

Wilames to G.F., 1656, London [this is by George Fox]
: From Will[iam] Aimes to M.F. [hand unidentified]

Contents:
Lengthy salutation to the receiver of this letter full of fulsome praise to him [or her if to M.F.] and to the Lord; "I passed to Sonderling [Sunderland] upon the fift[h] day wheare I was kindly received by oure freinds and John Richardson past with me and spake to Roger Harper conserning provision for my journey according to thy directions given unto him, who was ready to comply. Shipping heare is which will sudenly pass to Holland...I am exceedingly prest in spirit to be gon. I hope it will be in the begining of the next weeke"; desires to hear from him [or her] as often as possible and it likely that Roger Harper "will be an instrument to convey thy letters unto me"
: This is briefly abstracted in JFHS, XXVII (1930), 21-22
Research Notes: Horle Listing disputes Receiver--"Will[iam] Ames to G.F. [the latter is endorsed by George Fox, but someone else has written on the endorsed side, "From Will[iam] Aimes to M.F. [Margaret Fell]"; it was probably written to Fox]

Research Notes: NNR 2024-02: Letter is from "J.C." but archivist notes state it could either be Jospeh Coale or Josiah Coale, from my viewing of the letter the backside looks to say Joseph Coale spelled "J seph". It also states that it was known that Josiah Coale was the companion of Howgill at the time. I will add both names to the sender place.

Contents: [Virtually identical with number 206; however this appears to be the rough draft; also in number 206 a portion of the letter which relates to Anthony Burrough was heavily crossed through, but here the passage, while crossed out, can be disciphered, and is as follows- after noting that Burrough went to [Joseph] Grig's [Grigg's] house who sold ale and where some men were drinking on a market day, Burrough "put off his hatt and said 'I will pledge you Sir', and one did drink to him and he said, "Thanke you Sir' and put off [his] hatt, and then this was noised and talked upp and downe in ye north and we thought it had been lyes, but ye woman of ye house came to Swarthmore yt sold ye aile...and I asked her whether this was true or noe, and she said itt was too true and it greived her, and more over she said she took ye s[ai]d Burrough aside (one of J[ohn] S[tory's] Sep[ar]ate Company), and asked him why hee would doe so, and he said to her againe if it was his weakness, why could not she look over itt?"]

Contents: Is sorry that Hen[ry] Sweeting and his wife [Ann] and Tho[mas] Baill [Beale] and his daughter [Mary] and Nich[olas] Lucas "should...abuse my words as they have done"; understands "by thyne and R[ichard] Thomas letter that Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] saith he ownes yt paper sent to Jo[h]n Story and will stand by itt and he had more witnesses"; this means that "he stands by lyes and those witnesses of his are false, and was not Tho[mas] Dockrey [Dockray] then by in his hall, who saith he heard not such words, neither ye matter of charge spoken as Hen[ry] Sweet[ing] sayth itt"; is sorry "for Tho[mas] Baills [Beale] who saith though he heard not those words spoken by mee, yet yt hee should believe ym to be true"; as for Edwar[d] Parkin's "saying he cannot remember yt he heard 'whores and rogues', but saith I might say so,...herein hee is more passive. Nay, I doe believe yt neither Edw[ard] Parkins nor none of ye rest can remember yt I spoak those words as Hen[ry] Sweeting has affirmed in his paper"; as for Edwas[d] Parkin's saying "yt he witnesseth yt I said, 'M[aste]r [John] Story' and of putting off hatt and of sending for ye woman of ye house to know ye truth of itt etc., this is forgerys and falsehood and wilfull mistakes of him (as hereafter I shall manifest) and Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] and his wife [Ann] of Tho[mas] Baill [Beale] or daughter [Mary] or any others, and Tho[mas] Bail's daughter saying yt I said ye same to her at Rich[ard] Martin's yt is false also, and it's strange yt neither Rich[ard] Mart[in] nor his wife nor children should not hear as well as shee, and I might very well ask Nich[olas] Lucas for his author and call him a lyer when he said such words as I never said, but Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] did badly yt he being ye author could not stand up then and witness it to my face when he see [saw] Nich[olas] Luc[as] much downe,...but this manifests ye imperiousness of Nich[olas] Luc[as] to cast lyes in my face and did not know his author, and now it seems Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] was his author"; however rather then "stand to these lyes before my face" he [Henry Sweeting] drew up a paper "behinde my back" and then sent it "into ye north which is spread upp and downe in Westmerland [Westmorland] and Yorkshire, without sending it first to mee to know ye Truth of itt, for I met wth Hen[ry] Sw[eeting's] pap[er] in Yorkshire before I came into Lancashire" reproves them for the way in which they acted; "now as to ye matter of ye false charge- Tho[mas] Baill, Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] and Nich[olas] Lucas were speaking much of liberty of conscience at Hen[ry] Sw[eeting's] house and other places...[and] I told ym yt under a pretence of libery of conscience all manner of looseness and wickedness would hide itselfe,...and I instanced two couples concerning marriages in Glostershire [Gloucestershire] and one of them was a butcher yt said 'You', 'Sir' and 'Master', and put of[f] his hatt to people, who came to a mens meeting and said hee took such an one to be his wife and she said she took such an one to be her husband etc. (and she went under ye name of a Freind, but not hee), and how they brought cakes and bottles of bear [beer] or wine and went to eat and drinke etc., and these would come but once to ye mens meeting"; also told "of another couple yt would not come to ant meeting at all, and how yt a woman had drawne ym upp a pittifull certificate. I told ym also I had ye hearing of these things in a meeting appointed on purpose near Worstershire [Worcestershire] and they pleaded liberty of conscience and yt their marriages was as good as any of ours"; instanced these things to them "to convince ym yt there must be something more then only conscience to distinguish a good conscience from a badd, for there must be ye Spirit of God and ye Light of Christ to enlighten ye conscience, for many raw, loose, younge people may talke of conscience that did not know what if was, and also I instanced another marriage in Westmerland [Westmorland] yt ye man was engaged to another woman in Lancashire, and them of ye Seperate Meeting knew yt ye man was so engaged, yet they suffered him to be marryed with another woman, and such contract breakers may plead liberty of conscience"; as for putting off hats, "I instanced one Burrough's son yt came with Jo[h]n Story and Jo[hn] W[ilkinson] to mee at Swarthmore [Swarthmoor], who went to one Grigg's house yt sold aile [ale], and some men being drinking there on a market day [there follows two lines heavily crossed through]...[and] these inclosed certificates doth shew both what Anthony Burrough said and did yn"; [there follows six lines heavily crossed through]; "And this I brought but only to convince them of ye danger of youth and under pretence of pleading liberty of conscience runn into looseness, but it's manifest little sence had Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] and ye rest of my care of Truth,...who hath not understood my words, but wrested and perverted them"; and as for "those word's, 'M[aste]r Story', and 'whores and rogues',...these are forgeryes and horrid lyes and perversions,...for this abovesaid is ye Truth as I said to informe them of ye danger of false liberty and false conscience etc., but Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] and Nich[olas] Luc[as] and ye rest, their consciences is broad enough and their tongues without a bitt as may be seen in their paper to Jo[h]n Story's Sep[ar]ate company yt they boast so much of"; they must repent or else "ye Lord will reward them according to their workes"; also whereas Nich[olas] Lucas "boasts and says yt I told another lye [at] [H]untington [Huntingdon] in saying I had not seen those papers yt Rob[er]t Raby had, and it seems Tho[mas] Baill is his wit[ness] etc., [to] this I answer, the younge man was high and captious and I asked him for ye papers and hee would neither give me them nor let me see them, though I and others was concerned in them. Now, how could I say in truth and righteousness yt I had seen them when as it was said there was 24 sheets of them, but yt which Lewas [Lewis] Landy [Laundy] had was but about 13 or 14 sheets, and I had seen but little of itt, so I could not certainely know yt I had seen them because they might differ from ye other, and I knew not what was in those papers yt Rob[er]t Raby had, and I doe not know yt I said positively I had not seen them, and therefore ye lye is with Nich[olas] Luc[as] and Tho[mas] Baill [Beale], for I had not ye papers together to compare them or give them to others to compare, and ye report was yt some was 13 sheets and others 16 sheets, and others 24 sheets, so how could I tell it was ye same with Luas [Lewis] Landy's [Laundy's]? And yn when Rob[er]t Raby would not give them [to] mee, I testified ag[ain]st ym to be works of darkness from covenant breakers, whose agreem[en]t was at Bristoll [Bristol] yt noe papers should goe forth of those thinges without consent of 6 Freinds on either side. And as for those 13 or 14 sheets of pap[er] of ye works of darkness yt we demanded of Lues Landy, which as I take itt Ch[ristopher] Taylor or some other did read, here a peice and there a peice, and I did not so much as see whose hand it was or whose names was att itt, and it's like I heard not ye 8th part of it read and so how should I know yt it was ye same with yt wch Rob[er]t Raby had, to say yt I had yt wch he had, wch report was 24 sheets, for yt wch Lu[wis] Landy had Sam[uel] Goodaker [Goodacre] took...with him wth out my seeing it all over, but only some parts as afores[ai]d, and Luas Landy was so shy yt we could not get ye originall of him, but only Sam[uel] Gooda[cre] to take a coppy of it, and send him it againe, but it manifests their base spirit contrary to their owne agreem[en]t to send pap[er]s behinde our backs and never send us a coppy, who was therein concerned"; also hears "of another paper stuft with lyes and slanders given forth by W[illia]m Rogers ag[ain]st mee and is spread upp and downe, filled up wth such calumnyes and forgeryes as I never heard of before. If you hear of itt in your parts you may detect itt to purpose. This evill, surmiseing prejudiced spirit carryes people below com[m]on morall men"; also whereas Jo[h]n Story 'saith as to ye Sep[ar]ate Meeting in Westmerland to man[n]age church affaires, he never was att any of them to this day, neither was he of counsell with them about any business they transacted in those meetings to this day etc. Answer- In this Jo[h]n Story gives himselfe ye lye under his owne hand, for J.S. [John Story] and J.W.'s [John Wilkinson's] names is both at ye pap[er] of prescriptions and articles of ye Sep[ar]ate Meeting, and Jo[hn] Sto[ry's] brothers and Jo[hn] W[ilkinson's] sons, their names was at ye said pap[er] also. And againe, was it not proved yt Jo[hn] Story was at a Sep[ar[ate] Meeting, and Jo[h]n W[ilkinson] continued among them, and there not ye most p[ar]t of 20 come of[f] ym whose names was at ye pa[per] of sep[ar]ation and hath given forth pap[er]s of condemnation of ym and yt spirit yt led ym into ye sep[ar]ation? And their words is not to be regarded amongst sober men"; have sent Hen[ry] Sw[eeting's] "pap[er] of lyes to Jo[h]n Story to see if he would owne itt, who had spread it upp and downe and never sent it to mee, but as I mett wth it by chance in Yorkshire and yet he never sent me noe answer to this day. And here is a certificate inclosed [no longer with the letter] from two of Jo[h]n Story['s] neighbours who very well knowes yt J.S. hath been an incourager of ye Sep[ar]ate Meeting in Westmerland wch you may shew, both to enemies and Freinds with ye other two certificates, and let Hen[ry] Sw[eeting] and Tho[mas] Baill and Nich[olas] Lucas and ye rest see what I have written and signifie itt abroad so far as you hear yt these their lyes is gone"; love "to you all and your wives and Tho[mas] Burr and to all Freinds yt queryes after mee"; [the next section is by Thomas Dockrey [Dockray]- hopes that "this true and plaine relation with the enclosed certificates about the things in question...will satisfie you and give you a full understanding of ye ground and rise of ym"; love to them all; [the next section is addressed to Hen[ry] Stout and signed by Ezekiell Woolley]- "This cam[e] to my hand by post last night, so I having this opertunety sent it away this morning by ye coach , not at all quisoning [questioning] but thee wilt...wth ye rest of Friends...see it perform[e]d acording to ye desir[e] therein mentioned"; love "to thee and thy wif[e] [Mary nee Saunders]:' (postscript- "My wif[e] [Mary] and Bridget['s] lov[e] is to thee and wif[e] an[d] to Friends wth min[e] as y[o]u hast fredom")

Abstract: A Paper by John Rous in answer to Babel's Builders Unmasking Themselves By Thomas Crispe [Crisp] [see number 46] 

Dated: 
Barbados, ye 28th of ye 11th mo[n]th [January], 1681[2] 

Contents: 
In a preface to the reader, Rous notes that the occasion for Crispe's [Crisp's] book was "a paper written at a Quarterly meeting in Barbados intended to gather into the unitie of God's holy spirit and to exclude nothing but yt renting and dividing spirit wch...would oppose the universall spirit of God" confesses that he was "not active in the promoting [of] it,...but finding yt envy and mallice hath taken occasion at ye shortnes in wording of it and high reflections are cast, not only on the persons immediately concerned, but upon the tender reproofes and advice of those Freinds who answered it and also upon Freinds in generall, as if by this paper a discovery were made of some secreet designe (under the pretence of men and womens meetings) to embondage and bring into slavery those who are subject to ye wholesome advice rec[eive]d from those meetings,... I am engaged in my spirit to write something to clear the innocent in this matter"; the purpose of the paper "was to establich concord and exclude the spirit of discord,... and was managed without force or compulsion,... and the personby whose meanes it came to be divulged had a coppie to consider of before he joyned in it, wch he carrying to some who having little love for Truth, thinking they had a great occasion agst Freinds...sent it to London to some...bad or worse spirits, who have not spared to make the worst of it"; the latter have not acted for the good of the Truth or else they would not "in soe publick a place as Gracechurch street meeting to have exposed it to the sight and hearing of such an assembly, or by printing to have exposed it to the view of all"; the book they brought forth [Babel's Builders unmasking Themselves] is "stuffed with perversions, slanders, lies, confusion and contradictions" : [Rous now begins his paper entitled. "Envy and mallice Displayed in their Propper Colours"]; attacks Crisp's argument that the paper was promoted by G.F.'s [George Fox's] party; although in the preface [of Babel's Builders] "it is said the intent of publication of this ensuing paper and letter...is not to reflect upon or reproach in generall the people called Quakers or in contempt of their principle, yet it doth appear yt ye mallice is soe great yt none yt keep to and abide in the practice of their principle shall escape, ye incectives are soe generall, and they you are most sparing towards are those of your owne spirit, who though they may be called Quakers, yet are departed from and stand in opposition to the life and power"; they are in fact "seperates, stubborne Caines [Cains], Judas's [and] apostates"; as for what is quoted from Is[aac] Pennington [Penington] and Edw[ard] Burrough in the preface [of Babel's Builders], "take their words as they were written without perversion, and there is noe disagreem[en]t between w[ha]t they have written and we practice"; as for the paper itself " a coppie wherof you have printed, but not agreeable to the originall, wch you say in abhorrencie wherof other persuasions have posted,...it may be they might set it up there to publick veiw as yours also was set up in a bad house, yet this doth nothing but denote the prejudice of ym yt did it"; the paper "was not worded soe aptly or full as it should have been wherby to demonstrate the sincere intentions of those who subscribed it,...but though I was present and heard the whole matter discoursed, I did not hear nor understand anything was intended but the promoting the practicall part of Christianitie without constraint in love and unitie to walke and act sccording to the universall spirit of God"; this is "according both to Scripture and ye principle at first oreached among us" or to draw any from it "but to prevent the abuse to many put upon it, who pretend they are guided by it when they act contrary to it"; it is reasonable "in things yt are dubious or not sufficiently expressed, that every man should be the interpreter of his owne words and not as you have done by this paper to strain the tearmes beyond w[ha]t in reason they will bear"; since the paper was drawn and subscribed "there hath been noe use made of it to the prejudice of any nor answerable to y[ou]r mallicious surmises though it was neer a year before we either rec[eive]d the sence of Freinds concerning it or saw w[ha]t ill use was made of it in y[o]ur booke"; they [Crisp et al] "are not satisfied only in casting y[o]ur abusive aspersions on the paper, but you also vilifie and abuse the Freinds who writ the answer [ George Fox, Alexander Parker, and George Whitehead] ...[who] were (without doubt) both sencible yt good was intended (though not well expressed) and also sencible how malliciously it would be reflected on if it came to the hands of such as you are"; the book seeks to "sow discention among brethren...tearming Freinds 'the Foxoman sect' and 'Foxomans' and would make ym as bad or worse then ye papists"; they [Crisp et al] appear to be "men of perverse mindes and spirits because they run "to such a heighth of prejudice and enmitie where the difference is soe small, as yee acknowledge...your-selves, for yee confesse the difference is about the forme and power of womens meetings and having them meet apart from the men, when they have noe busines requires it, and the other thing yee object agst is about the forme of marriages...but doe not shew w[ha]t is ye forme yee object agst. As for the womens meetings, both in cities, townes and countries, it doth appear to be most convenient for them to meet in such a manner as may best answer the end of their meeting, and the end of their meeting being to take care of women, and as well in the countries as sities or townes, if men and women meet together and womens affaires present wch are not fir to be discoursed before men w[ha]t must they doe? Either let it alone or withdraw? And where soe much busines doth not present as in sities or great townes, may they not spend the time they have to spare to their mutuall comfort in waiting upon the Lord, and keeping their usuall times are alwaies ready to answer their service as it presents, and wheras none are compelled to come to the womens meetings agst their freedome, what injurie is done to any yt this should make soe great a difference?"; all of this "appears not only unchristian like, but irrationall yt soe small differences shouls produce soe great annimosities"; one can only conclude that "the spirit of Beliall hath entred you wch cannot endure the yoke of Christ, and this cryes out agst the order of the Gospel extablished in men and womens meeting as impositions wheras nothing is imposed on but yt wch bears not the yoke of Christ"; by abusing the Church of Christ they deprive it "of the power He hath given it" and what will become of them when "the Devill comes to be cast out"; they are only aiding the enimies of Truth who will now say, "Ha Ha ...the Quakers are divided"; they are wrong in thinking that an occasion has been given here, for there is "a great deale of difference between giving an occasion weakly or ignorantly for want of well wording a good intent, and doeing it wilfully and malliciously in enmitie and prejudice"; they have not only rejoiced "at any weaknes among God's people, but aggravate it in the highest nature yt may be...as if you thought you never could doe the Devill service enough"

Was comforted and refreshed “in thy company when I had the oppertunity to speak wth thee once or twice in London”; unfortunately when he [G.F.] went into the country, “I was then almost uncapable to vissit thee, being altogether a stranger to those parts, soe yt without a guide it was hard for mee to finde the way”; acquainted some Friends in London “yt I had a desire to see thee before I went to Maryland, but I perceived theire occations could not permit theire goeing just at yt time, yet once I gott a pilote to Edward Mann’s country house where I hoped to meet the[e], but thou was gone from thence”; would not have troubled him with this, “butt…I was not clearly satisfied in my owne minde yt I did no[t] see thee againe before I went, the ship goeing something sooner then expected”; however “I did wright a few lines to thee wch in thy letter to us thou signifies thee did receive, but as to the memorandum yt the[e] left and now have sent us conver[n]ing the books, I doe not remember yt I ever saw it until I see it here in Maryland, but however as it happened, I did pretty well comply wth it, for some of thy primers I carried and several books of the Statutes in Breviates, and for answers to the dirty books wright agt Friends, I doe think most Friends in these parts have of them and I doe not remember yt I ever heard of any of them dirty books yt ever was brought into these parts (ex[c]ept one of [William] Rogers) and yt was kept soe close yt Freinds could never gett it although sought for it to destroy it”; Friends have received “thy severall letters sent this yeare, wth the inclosed condemnations, Epistles and acco[unts] of proceedings in our behalfe wth ye L[or]d Baltimore, and thy last wth the King’s [James II] order to the Mayor of London. Wee are in hopes it will be of service here. Our last mo[nthly] meeting have apoynted some Freinds to goe and discoarse those yt are cheife in authority here and to lay our conditions of suffering once more before them and to lett them see as many of those inclosed papers thou sent us… and when wee have rec[eive]d theire answere and resolution thou may expect Freinds here will give thee a full acco[unt] of all theire proceeding”; they all acknowledge his [G.F.] care and labour “for our inward and outward prosperrity” and God will reward him

Received his [letter] the previous day at Kendall [Kendal]; “I have been lately (came home 4 dayes since) in ye county of Durham and in ye edge of Northumberland and Freinds are generally well, and a good care upon them in ye concerns of ye Monthly and Q[uarterly] meetings”; attended several of them “and I was comforted therein, onely R.W’s [Richard Watson’s; see also number 80] break is Freinds great exercyse and greife. All he hath anyway, I doubt, will not pay halfe he owes. Divers honest Freinds like to be almst ruined by him. I was in Cumberland this summer and things are well there. At Swarthmoor and Marsh [Grange], I was before I went to Durham”, and all was well there; is glad to hear that the Truth prospers everywhere, “ye account whereof thou hast given mee”; sorry for “ye exercyse ocasioned through ye death of our Freinds in Pensilvania [Pennsylvania], T.L. [Thomas Langhorne], J. Ha. [James Harrison], yet they were men of corrupt, foul bodys. T[homas] Lang[horne] looked upon here likely to be a man of a short life. I was something sor[r]y to heare yt you should soe often beare upon the matter of Freinds death there, saying yt that Province had been a grave for many of ye Lord’s servants, and in this instanceing such as have been taken away there in 5 or 6 years time, telling Ro[bert] Barrow under that consideration that it… was well or yt he may be glad he stayed home. Deare George, though may beare me, it’s yt honourable respect I have for …W[illiam] Pen [Penn],… and yt tender, living exercyse with many teares yt T[homas] Langhorne was exercused in, touching his goeing thither, which ocasions me to think thou beares too hard up[on] those and other good men who have lived to God and are laid downe in peace. I am exercysed under ye thoughts of ye many worthy men in Ingland [England], God’s able ministers in a few years yt were taken away in ye prime of their age: E.B. [Edward Burrough], R[ichard] Hub[berthorne], W[illiam] Ca[ton], J[ohn] Aud[land], Jo[hn] Camm, Jos[iah] Coale, G[eorge] Harison [Harrison], -F[rancis] H[ogwill]”, along with many brethren “taken away in ye time of ye great plage [plague i.e. the Bubonic plague of 1665] in London in a short time. Great is ye wisdome of God and secret His counsell and submission to Him in all things is ye best state. With respect to Amerika [America] and Freinds removing from their native countrys and any way, wee are taught by ye various dealings of ye Lord to be serious, weighty and in abundance of feare to ye Lord that where ever our lott may fall, our dayes may be comfortable to us and ye refreshing of God’s heritage, our latter end peace, and ye possession of life and glory our portion for ever. I saw thy letter to Tho[mas] Robertson, and touching T[homas] Lawson whom in that thou mentions, he is not a good man. He hath been ye weakening of Freinds hands in every ex[ercise] these 20 years and never any helpe to them yt any account cann be given by them [of the] meeting he belongs to, a great ocasioner of evell to be spoken of ye Truth [torn], [and] a strong society he hath amongst men of ye world in sitting and tipling with y[m]. [His] eldest daughter [Ruth] was concern[e]d with a young preist [Christopher Yeats] as to mariag[e] and although [he] seemed in words oppose it, yet he took ye man into his house 3 weeks dureing yt concerne to teach him and not long after they maryed with a preist and Thomas Lawson tooke him home to his house next day and hath kept him ever since about halfe a yeare, and yet will not adknowledge any weakness in w[ha]t he hath done. Pray thee concerne him not too much in publict concerns of Truth untill he become[s] more comfortable to ye honest Freinds he live amongst. It will wound them more then I desyre. If you writ[e] to him again I pray hart not me in any mistake, yet be certanly [certain] ye whol[e] meeting will avour [avow] w[ha]t I say and more. I pitty ym. They are honest and true and hee’s their exercyse and sorrow. I desyre he may see and repent”; love from “my wife and children to the[e], letting thee know yt my brother Francis Blaykling and two of our meeting more are gone to prisson for tythes and I am like to goe after this tearme [term] unlesse ye Lord beyound probabity [probability] prevent”

Although it has been “ a day of death and an houre of darknes wherein many hath laid downe their heads in endles misery, yet hath ye glorious light shined forth as clear as ye sun at noneday”; as for Friends in the ministry, “their hath none dyed but John Sheild [Shield] and John Fothergill, and as for Margrett [Margaret] Toones [Toone], she is pretty well and John Gibson is in health”; Francis Howgill “is yet a prisoner in Apleby [Appleby] and pretty well”; G.F. [George Fox] “is kept very close [in Scarborough Castle] and is not suffer[e]d to write”; W[illia]m Crouch “is in health”; George Gosnell, “ his wife [Hope] and children [one of whom was Lydia Gosnell] and deceased”; W[illia]m Bayly “is well in this citty [London]”; John Crooke [Crook] and Isaac Benington [Penington] are well; “We have heard from Jamaico [Jamaica] and Edward Brush and ye other Friend [James Harding] is arrived there and they have much liberty by ye Governour [Sir Thomas Modyford]”; have also heard “from Mevis [Nevis] from Tho[mas] Gibson and ye other seaven [seven] yt ye Lord struck ye Mas[t]er of ye ship dumb and about a forthnight [fortnight] after he dyed and was throwne over board about 4 days before they came to land. The governour, we heard, would not recive them unles they were willing to come ashoar”; “My husband [Thomas] desireth the[e] to acquaint Margrett [Margaret] Reynolds yt he would have her son to come home, Anthony [probably a servant of the Biddles] being dead, we have need of one [another servant?], and if he cometh not, he intendeth to have another in his steed [stead] and not to receive him againe. It is about 3 months agoe since our maid [Elizabeth, who died on the 14th of the 7th month i.e. September, 1665 of the plague] and Anthony dyed.

Salutes her “in ye Truth and in ye life of jesus”; as for that place [Bristol], sufferings continue as formerly and the meetings in the City are kept up “by a few, their being many in prison”, but those “of ye hreat booke party [the followers of William Rogers whose ‘great booke’ was The Christian-Quaker; Wing R1858] comes very litle now of late.

Has received “thine dated ‘Middelsex [Middlesex], the 28, 2 m. [April], [16]89’,… which was very acceptable to me and Friends here and have also send [sent] a copy to Friends at Dantsig [Danzig], of that thou didst mention concerning them in that letter, but as to the letter to the Magistrats themselves, seeing they were not going on whith [with] their hard persecution, we were more inclined to keep it back, till we see how things further will go, whether… their work they have begonn [begun] will lett fall, or no, but if they had gone on thereiwth, we were resolved to send they [thy] letter to them, and perhaps have printed it also and distributed amongst them and therr citizens,… but to our comofrt and our Friends at Dantsig also, we heare that they hquite have ceased of their persecution,… not molesting Friends any more, but they [Friends] enjoy their freedome as formerly as their meetings peaceably,… and therefore we have not send thy letter to the Magistrats at Dantsig, and we are right glad things were fallen out so”; however, the landlord “of the meeting house, which is a kind [kin] to the magistrats, has told the Friend that lives in the house to… remove against the winter, and says also that he hath lett the house all ready to another, and if so, Friends think it will be hard for them to gett another house to meet in”; love from Friends there “to thee and other faithfull Friends in Engeland [England]”; some days previously, “we have also received thy printed letter of the Yearly Meeting at London and also a book of thine called ‘The Antiquity of Our Faith, Hope, Way and Gospel’ ect. [Concerning the Antiquity of the People of God; Wing F1773], and one of W[illia]m Caton’s Journal [A Journal of the Life of William Caton; Wing C1514], which we were glad off, and if it comes to pass, we should be glad to have some few more of Wm Caton’s Journal… and as concerning the free gift of our breathren at London in remitting of the 50 lb. st[er]l[ing] to the relief of our poor Friends at Dantsig [Danzig], we were also very glad of, and we hope also to take care in time to come that there be no want amongst them. They acknowledge [acknowledge] also very much the tender care and love of the Englisch [English] and Holl[and] Friends concerning them. About 5 weeks ago, we have had our Jearly [Yearly] meeting here and Friends were very much refresshed amongst one another, being all in good unity”; things are generally well with Friends in Holland, Friesland, Hamborough [Hamburg], Frederikstatt [Friedrichstadt] and Embden [Emden]; John [Jan] Claus[’s] Father-in-law at Embden “is lat[e]ly deceased and in his sikness he gave now and then a good testimony for the Turht and Friends, expressing som[e]times his inclination to Friends remarkably. Friends there enjoy still their meetings peacebly, and the magistrats remain still affected to Friends, desiring that more Friends did come to dwell there”l love to W[illia]m Penn, “and when he is freed from his arrest, we desire to hear of with the first opportunity, and if it does consist with his freedom to write a letter himself to us, we should be very glad”; love “to thee” from he, his wife [Elizabeth] and many other Friends

For my Dear Father George Fox, this is London

Endorsed:
John Rous to G.F. and Frendes for advice to be given and sent to Barbatus, 1681, anesered [this
is possibly by George Fox]

Contents:
“I lately writ a letter to thee, G.W. [George Whitehead] and A.P. [Alexander Parker] wherein I gave you an acc[oun]t of my rec[eip]t of y[o]ur answer [for this answer, see Thomas Crisp, The
First Part of Babel’s-Builders Unmasking Themselves; Wing C6951, pp. 4-5] to the Quarterly Meeting’s paper [for this paper, which was subscribed by 82 men and women Friends of Barbados on 23.x.1680, see Thomas Crisp’s , The First Part etc., p.4] and yt it was read at our last Quarterly Meeting at Ralphs Fretwel’s [Fretwell’s] and that there was a generall submission to y[o]ur judgement on the paper and yt the paper was taken out of the booke and your answer put in the place. Also I advised you how Jo[h]n Weale proposed the giving forth of a paper of condemnation wch upon some discourse with him since, I doe understand he did not intend for all the subscribers, but only for R.F. [Ralph Fretwell] who drew ye paper. I doe understand yt some Freinds in England have judged that he hath been hardly dealt with, both in taking the
meeting from his house and in Freinds in England have judged that he hath been hardly dealt with, both in taking the meeting from his house and in Freinds withdrawing at other times. W[he]n the meeting was there, Freinds found it was an opportunitie of those who were not well affected to Truth getting together and uttering their prejudice ag[ain]st Freinds and it was hard to have a friendly correspondencie with him at other times without being frequently troubled with hearing his discontents ag[ain]st diverse Freinds, but yt if Freinds have been short or anything to hard heretofore, yt noe meanes might be left untryed wher[e]by to bring him into unitie, they offered for a tryall to remove a meeting (neerby) to his house and to passe by and overlooke all yt was past, and if he could not bury all without some further satisfaction in discourse, when his
spirit was coole and love uppermost, they would would be willing to have a meeting with him and discourse things with a desire of his satisfaction, but he doth not seeme inclinable to any motion yet made to him. His prejudice seemes to be most ag[ain]st R.F., and it is thought he would overlooke all besides and R.F. hath appeared very desirous to remove the prejucice, but J.W. [John Weale] is not willing to joyne with him in it”; a book has some there entitled Babel’s Builders Unmasking Themselves [by Thomas Crisp; Wing C6948] “wherin are many reflections both on the paper written here and your answer [the paper and answer appear on pages 5-7] wch hath been of some service, for by it some who were violent saw how...they came to those bad spirits yt writ it, and how they agred in their reflections, wch I had something upon my spirit to write an answer to and sned here enclosed [see number 47], leaving it to the judgm[en]t of thee and Freinds to alter w[ha]t you may see convenient, or whether to print it or not [apparently it
was not printed], for I suppose Freinds in England, not knowing the end and intent in writing it, though very charitable in answering it, could not be soe possitive in stopping that flood of aspersions cast upon Truth by neanes of it, as one yt was present and heard and saw all yt Truth is concerned in answering it, yt those bould aspertions cast on Truth may be wiped of[f]. We [Rous, his wife, Margaret [nee Fell, jr], and children] have a great desire to goe to England and doe thinke to begin our voyage about the beginning of the 3d month [May], but if my busines will not permit me, I thinke my wife [Margaret] and children may goe and I may follow” ; Christopher Newham “is come hither, but doth not appear well pleased, neither doe I understand he concernes himselfe as formerly” ; R.F. [Ralph Fretwell] intends to go to England “this year’
and will leave “his son Ralph in his busines”; uncertain at present, but they may all go together; “I hope in time things may be well here, for since the proposing of a generall unitie, meetings are
much fresher yn [then] they have bin”; wife [Margaret] and children are well “’and our duty is presented to thee and my mother [Margaret Fell]”; (Postscript- “If thou writes to me about any
publick concernes of Truth, direct thy letter for me or in my absence for Joseph Borden, who is a very honest Freind”)

Contents: "I nott being willing to exc[e]ed 2 sheets, had nott room to mention all ye pervertions in them Few Words, as yt in pag[e] 17 [of John Field's, A Few Words to Nath[aniel] Coleman's late Epistle, which includes a brief comment from Richard Richardson; see also number 223], y[o]u say I foolishly quot[e] my Babell's [this refers to Crisp's series of pamphlets under the general heading of Babel's Builders Unmasking Themselves], but y[o]u also in pag[e] 20 quot[e] ye...boock of R[obert] Sandilands [Righteous Judgement Placed; Wing S661] which is as wicked as myn[e] is foolish. Alsoe R.R. [Richard Richardson] in pag[e] 20 charg[es] me with 4 errors in 8 letters, which is yt I wrong spell the word 'Rapsody' [Rhapsody]"; this manifests that they "only want matter to contend about, els[e] y[o]u would never troubl[e] the world with such things in print, butt...[were] ye faults of now [no] worse consequense then a word mispeld, I think y[o]u had nott heard of yt in print from me, butt I doe say I can spell as well as G[eorge] Fox could doe [do] when he or sum[e] for him subscribed (to severall language[s] his name) espesially when I hav[e] had soe many letter learn[e]d ones (and as long as he hav[e] had) to teach and cor[r]ect me"; then on page 18, "y[o]u mention sum[e] termes I hav[e] used and say they manifest whatt spiritt I am off. Sum[e] of them as 'cheat' and 'informer' manifest a bad spiritt, then yes, is such. Alsoe ye learned R.R. [Richard Richardson] brag[s] of his being able to peerce [pierce]. Inde[e]d the Scriptur[e] mention[s] sum[e] whos[e] words eat as a kankor u[pon?] th[eir?] sense. He and others of y[o]u may be said to be piersing, as well as he is learned, in lying [and] alsoe in the act of... bringing sumthing to nothing as he hav[e] doone [done], who alsoe I fear, hav[e]...bin instrumentall to bring off S.N.'s [unidentified] and others too, to nothing. I intend to print a small tract intitled' G[eorge] Fox Unmask[e]d' [it does not appear that this was, in fact, printed] whering I think will be manifest[ed] the evill and danger of being the sam[e] or one mind and judgment wth him, iff he hav[e] nott changed his mind, which I may conclud[e] he hav[e] nott becaus[e]...changing...se[e]ms nott alowable by ye [your] prinsaple. This...will be warrantable from G.W.'s [George Whitehead's] proce[e]d[ing] and writing against F.B. [Francis Bugg] [and] also from ye [your] dealings with others...T.C. [perhaps the initials of the unknown printer of The Sixth Part of Babel's Builders] left out 'in conclusion' and other words in sum[e] pages as which I cannot now cor[r]ect. If any one of ye can in the Spiritt of charrety shew me my error, I shall take itt kindly"; [there is a message written to R.R. on side three, in a different hand, which is unidentified- "I have p[er]used this Innocency Vindicated fals[ely [probably relating to number 247a by T.C.] (so call'd) and find it rather rayling manifested and yt T.C.

He said he had read Roger’s book and he had read our answere to itt, the book from the 2[n]d Dayes Meeting [George Whitehead, The Accuser of our Brethren Cast Down; Wing W1887] and saith he, ‘I shall lett them both allone and you shall never be wiser from me, nor have further answere of that matter’. There was one Freind of our towne asked James Moore if he owned W.R.’s booke and he said yes he owned itt, but if I should aske him such a question, he would not answere me positively but with shiftes and evasions,… soe when wee have got J.W.’s answere, then I shall send such an account as I can gett from them, but I p[er]ceive itt will be mixt with shifts and mudlement for they have lost there currage and manhood as men. This weeke was Edmond Newbye [Newby] of Hytton burryed, he being formerly one of the seperat[e] subscribers in the time of his weakenesse, his distemper being ac onsumption, and when death semed to draw neare, itt pleased God to give him a penitent heart to bemoane his former negligence, and car[e]lesnesse concerning Truth, in which state he opened his heart to me, sayeing that though he had subscribed with J.S. [John Story] and J[ohn] Wilkinson, yett he never appeared against us in any other of there proceedings. He thanked God… who had preseved him, and he did not like J.W.’s proceedings, especially of late times,… and he hath given 31 pounds to the use of our Freinds and hath in his will given itt positively to Bryan Lancaster and me without any other ‘if’ or ‘and’ or provisoe, and hath givenn us private direction on how to imploye itt or leave itt to our discretion, and this, his doeing, hath given Wilkinson and his partye another stroake which is comed upon them suddenly and unexpectedly,… but they are soe darkened and hardened that they will not see nor consider, but wee know and alwayes doth beeleeve that all things shall worke together for good to them that love God”; “I was att your meeting att Greate [Great] Strickland, itt will be two weeks tomorrow,… and alsoe att Shapp [Shap] in the evening, because of which,… I could not well goe to see thy familly, onely heard of thy litle deare Sarah’s being ill, and this day [a] weeke, I heard by John Ayrey of Shapp [Shap] that she was verry weake. I have heard nothing since. Doubtless thou hath an account of itt more fully then I can give thee, onely I doe greatly pitty thy wife’s [Grace nee Whitehead] deepe exercise”; (postscript- love to “dear Francis Dove and his famillye, to John Vaughton and Freinds who enquires after me”)

Ralff Fretwell’s…papers, 1681, to be louk [looked] in to when hee comes to London [this is by George Fox]

Contents: 
“Thine I recei[ve]d at our Quarterly Meeting ye 10th mo. Last [December, 1681] intymateing after other things as after, vizt: ‘And remember my love to Soll. E. [Solomon Eccles] and Jo[h]n R[ous] that I desire all who are minister in yt island [Barbados] an yt have testimonyes for ye Lord may have a meeteing together and yt they may bee familliar one with annother and in love and unity, and whatever is amisse and past, let it beecome over…for they that speake must bee in unity however, else itt will distract ye hearers and scatter and make partyes,…and if you had a meeteing every other second day (as it is here in London every second day) it might doe well, and that all might take their motions and places that they go unto that all meeteings might bee supplyed,… and that you may bee sure to keepe out of that ill custome of hurteing and strife and contention in your meeteings,…but if there bee any difference betweene any minister or others, let itt be ended privately out of meeteings that ye peace of God may bee kept among breitheren,…but I desire that ye meeteing of ministers may bee settled before Sollomon comes over’”; that advice came after S.E. [Solomon Eccles] had left and therefore “ I shewed itt unto M[argaret] Rous and Jo[h]n [Rous] and R[ichard] Forde [Ford] and gave ym a copie of it to consider that ye thing might bee managed accordeing to thy advise” and desired that “wee foure” might meet “to consider further of itt with such other Friends as they deemed conveninent (since Sollomon was not here), but Jo[h]n was not willing, as by ye sequell, but carried itt to others to advise, wch I came more fully to understand by Margett [Margaret Rous] and others, and allso what past at two meeteings, by wch I perceived they neither would folloe that wch was formerly agreed on or answer thy instructions wch Ri[chard] Forde, Margett and I intreated for (ye later) or that ye things might continue in peace untell Hen[ry] Currer came it some ellder, or that thou was advised with”; had not gon[e] about or mett on purpose to know where their service might bee, or to take their motions, I used not to appeare, or if there (or any other occation), to withdraw, for ever since W[illia]m Brand’s time I used to bee very cautious to prevent occation of offence in anything yt might relate to ye ministerie…though I did see and heare, I was not willing to conserne my selde except for their incouridgm[en]t in their services. Therefore I tould Hen[ry] Currer I was not willing to conserne myselfe in speakeing or writeing about B.B. [perhaps this relates to Thomas Crisp’s The First Part of Babel’s Builders Unmasking Themselves; Wing C6951], and Christopher Newham and ye Masters of Shippd declared they were satisfied concerneing those reportes wch O.H. [Oliver Hooton] and some others seemed to stand by, as having tould ym, and all they could alleadge was some words spoke[n] by Jo[h]n Cartwright 8 yeres agoe at Oliver’s [Oliver Hooton’s] howse ye first day after hee came, wch some Friends that were there cleared beefore the masters of ye shipps. Now hee had desired mee to accquaint him with ye meeteing places till hee knew ye countrie. I have suffered prety much in beareing things this last yeare or more (hoping things would end) accordeing to ye desire of thee and other good Friends, but since things in some respects may bee feared to widen and ye more when I am come away, or ye tender bee much burthened, I lay this perticular conserne before thee now, that thou may doe as thou sees meete in God’s wisedome. About three yeares agoe (wch I after gave thee accompt of) Truth springing in this place, there was a motion at Six Weekes Meeteing that Friends that had testimonyes might have a meeteing together to bee refreshed, and know their service, wch was readily granted by the meeteing” therefore they began to name those persons “that might bee of ye said meeteing (out of each meeteing)”; however there was “something of a dispute for and against some, soe this was with mee to speakr vizt: ‘That every breath of life might bee incouridged and preserved, wch was noted in ye agreement beeing unanimously consented’. Soe there was a twofold meeteing every other fortnight, vizt, to help ye tender and such as had had a testimony formerly, and at ye conclusion of itt that such as had a publique service might know their places next two first dayes followeing”; therefore, when Rich[ard] Forde “tooke out ye paper to read where ye meeteings were that travelling Friends might see their service and places, I used to withdraw (if there)”, as also did those who had testimonies “and travelled not”; at the meeting on the other fourteenth day none would appear “but such as had usually a service in declaration in meeteings of worship”, and as they had little before them “but their motions and places”, when the meeting would be at Bridge Towne [Bridgetown], “Friends did desire their children might bee there a little, but this was beofre ye chilldrens meeteings were settled in ye perticular meeteings, wch w[a]s settled above six mo[nth]s agoe, and there is now a prety appeareance of ym once a month in each particular meeteing in ye six meeteings”; therefore the meetinf of the ministry “cannot say there is now either chilldren or others with ym at one fouerteene dayes, wch in part answers thy instructions”; however, “I perceive that two or three of ye Friends in ye ministerie would have but one second day in ye month, and wholy to debarr all such as have small testimonyes from ye meeteing, and such as thow desires to send testimonyes abroad to other places, and wholy to take uppon them, without ye Six Weekes meeteing and Quarterly Meeteings, ye ordering and settling of meeteings whereas thou desired that there they all might bee settled and not alltered but by consent of ye same, and likewise they would take uppon ym ye corrospondency abroad wholy and severall other things, not alltogether fitt to bee wrote downe, as thou may perceive by some henerall expressions in publique, vizt: ‘You thinke the Six Weekes Meeteing to bee above or equall with ye ministerie, but you are mistaken’, alledging what hee had read in ye Booke of ye patriarchs, vist: though Juda [Judah] had ye Kingdome, yet Levy [Levi] had ye Preisthood, and as ye heavens were higher then ye earth, soe was the priesthood above ye Kingly government (wch words thou knowes who uses for his exalltation onely) but noe words was made of itt then, and I hope will not”; however, “Margett [Margaret Rous] and I tould him [this may be John Weale; see numbers 46, 48-49], itt was not to ye buissnesse, and there was noe neede of such expressions. They asked mee what was in my minde [and] I said I thought G.F.’s [George Fox’s] instructions were plane enough, and read them twice over (with other things in ye said letter) to prevent contention and strife, and I did beeleive thou would have ye Friends in ye ministerie to have a meeteing and that things might bee beegun and don[e] in love and unity, and yt they might waite…to see their motions and services by themsselves, and yt ye [they] might wth Friends that had testimoynes (and did send testimoynes) according to G.F.’s instructions allso meete to answer ye service of ye 2d dayes meeteing in London, both wch G.F. perticularizes, and that these meeteings might bee once every fouerteene dayes, vizt: one of ye dayes travellers might wholy have to themselves, and in ye other such as have testimonies in meeteings and send testimoynes abroad, may bee assistant in ye service of ye meeteing with ye travellers”; margett [Margaret Rous] felt this “would doe well, and most Freinds, but one, said they would take in such as they thought convenient as there were occation. I tould him I was afraid of noething but divissions and intreated ym if things could not bee don[e] peacebly, to stay till H.C. [Henry Currer] came, since I perceive thou was willing that ye meeteing should bee settled beefore S.E. [Solomon Eccles] came, seeing there might be neede of help, and that hee might know more of thy minde”; the Friends in the meeting parted with most of them “desireing yt things might rest untill H.C. or some ellder came or knew thy minde further of ye same, for they had had two meeteings beefore and were not satisfied. Allso I rode about 5 miles wth Ma[rgaret] Ro[us] homewards and wee discoursed of ye mat[t]er and I accquainted w[ha]t I had heard of Jo[h]n [Rous] and shee saod shee had beene perswadeing of him beefore and some designedly put things uppon him to answer their owne ends, and Truth wasnot singly minded in ye thing. But yesternight I recei[ve]d a letter from Margett wherein shee saith shee hopes things will bee better and desires mee to come upp, wch [i] intend before ye shipp goes, if shee saile not in ye morneing”; the results of all this is that “most of those yt have large declarations have beene hurt, and thender, uprighthearted Friends are afraid of ym if things should bee left wth ym wholy, wherein ye testimony is concerned, to bee approved or disaproved, and there are some that have not declaration, or little, that are better of judg[e]m[en]t and more waighty and of a more peaceable spirit…and can keepe things better, as beecomes ye honnor of Truth”; therefore leaves this “to thy weighty consideration allone”; but “as for ye masters of shipps sayeing, that I and Jo[h]n Rous opposed ye readeing of Friends paper, they were not soe faire as they might have beene to each of us in that, for neither of us was in ye meeteing when itt was stopt, and Jo[h]n was there beefore mee, who had an intention to see to yye readeing of itt, and beegan to read to himselfe, but findeing ye word ‘contention’ made a stop, and then I and others minded ym of ye agreem[en]t of Friends, but when wee saw what itt was, ordered itt to bee read twice with ye men at two severall times, and annother time wth ye weomen,…but ye opposers had gott a coppie before at their club and vitiated ye copie in 2 severall places and how things come soe to passe in London and to bee carried here, as they are, I doe not thinke much to conserne my selfe,…except write or speake wth thee, or am spoke unto by Friends”; as for the short paper “wch was wrote att Quarterly meeteing as ye sum[m]e or abreviate of what was spoken at ye Quarterly Meeteing at my howse, the inclosed will give thee accompt of that matter, beeing coppies of what is sent unto thee, Allexander [Parker], Geo[rge] W[hitehead] and W[illiam] Gibson by mee with this, but in two letters least thou should not bee in London”; Friends are willing “that thou may tak out any part of ye same to publish, or to add what may bee convenient for Truth, and wee shall owne ye same, beeing willing to deny our selves for Truth’s sake, that it may not bee blemished, espetially thorough our shortnesse and weakenesse”; Walter Benthall affirmed “in our Quarterly Meeteing last that a good Friend in ye ministery and ellder in London said itt [a paper given forth by the Quarterly meeting in Barbados n the 23rd of the 10th month i.e. December, 1680; see numbers 46-51] was not onely badly worded, but ye spirit of witchcraft [was] in him yt drew itt”; “Had I ever sent a coppie abroad I should have sent it ti thee, but when I heard that a Friend had delivered a copie, itt was as if a dagger had beene struck in my left side, and judged ye same the next Quarterly Meeteing, and Rich[ard] Forde was allso troubled and hee allso tould ye Friend of ye consequence,…and hee was presently sensible and sorrowfull for itt. Wee doe not heare that they have ye names [of those who signed the paper], or ever had, ye party coppeing it out in hast[e] onely tooke ye number. I moved that thy and Friends paper might bee putt in ye roome of itt [the paper of Barbados Friends] att Quarterly Meeteing beefore any notice from H[enry] Currer to prevent such as would have twisted our judgment in ye thing, who live here, and come to our meeteings, and love to spread such things, and have sent this abroad, but I have sent thee their names to doe as thee sees caswe by wch thou may allso see yt there was noe dissenting,…and I cannot say anything in yt there was noe dissenting,… and I cannot say anything in yt meeteing was amisse, but ye writeing or subscription wch there is noe neede of, I am satisfied, and did long beefore feare subscriptions (till incouridged), but…the three papers were most my writeing, with Friends adition or subtraction”; since the ships did not go in the morning, “I made a journey unto Jo[h]n Rowse’s [Rous’s] and Margett [Margaret Rous] informed mee that shee was fully satisfied with what I proposed as to ye meeteing beefore spoken, of Friends yt had testimoynes, and had discoursed ye matter wth him [John Rous] ahewing that spirites hee was goeing to gratifie in what ye [they] contrived and w[ha]t want there would bee of such goof Freinds as ye [they] would exclude when ye [they] were uppon any consernes of Truth’s testimony, beesides their motions and services in declarations, and desired him either to condesend to tender and weighty Friends,…or let things allone till H.C. [Henry Currer] came, and shee said shee hoped hee would (but Oliver [Hooton] and some others had beene much wth him of late in towne to incouridg[e] him), and I hope hee will”; as for “my son [Ralph Fretwell, jr],… hee is now arrived when I had allmost don[e] expecting of him, for Friends in ye cuntry was loath to lett him come, and hen[ry] Jackson stood with him in yt perticular, but uppon my spetiall order, hee gott an honnest Friend and his wife to looke after things, whome Hen[ry] Jackson and other Friends aproved of. Itt is better with my son yn Freinds here or I expected, for hee gained love where hee was in ye countrye by his deportement and bore his testimony against ye priest of ye parish, and understood there was a citation out against him, and to our relations stood by ye principles of Truth, and in perticular that of tyth[e]”, and when he was last in London, “hee met wth some of his scholefellows that had given testimoynes that were in print in ye Litle Booke, who putt of[f] their hatts and invited him unto ye taverne, but hee dealt wth them…ye same, and hee is verry sensible that those that goes from Truth are ye worst of men, and hath a prety good understandng of things, better then I expected, but I indeavor to shew him his shortnesse. I perceive by him that young folkes finde wayes to understand how many things passe among ye ellders in London, but these things hee speakes of to my wife”; he says that he “went to Christopher Tayler’s [Taylor’s] and some other places to see thee accordeing to my order, but thou was gon[e] abroad into ye countrie, and heard that thou wert at Uxbridge, but itt was when ye ship was going to saile, or hee had gon[e] downe to Richard Richardson’s to thee. Hee said most of ye neighbours about my howse (att Hellaby in Yorkeshere [Yorkshire]), wch ye said Richard Richardson knowes, tould Ralph if hee would gett a meeteing there, they would come unto itt, and hee twice spoke to Hen[ry] Jackson, who did not speake anything against itt, or incouridg[e] itt…I know it is a convenient place for a meeteing, none beeing within 3 or 4 miles on it on any hand”; now that he has returned, “my minde inclines more towards England, to see thee and settle ye affaires there, and I hope way will bee made for ye same”; Eliz[abeth] Carter has arrived “having beene abroad in New England, Virginea [Virginia], and parts adjoyneing” and says “there is greate service for good Friends in Virginea, but they had neede to bee good Friends”; she sends her love; love to “thee, Margrett [Margaret Fox nee Fell] and your whole family with other Friends thou sees meete”

Was moved of the Lord “to goe to Morland stepllhouse [Steeplehouse] to declare ye word of God”; on coming into the place among the people, “there was one of those they call a minister [probably Pearce Burton, Vicar of Morland] speakeing of ye Saints conditions”; came before him “and waited for ye word of ye Lord, and he [Burton] speakeing on to ye people of ye Saints conditions and declareing unto them of a part of ye Scripture which spoke of holynes,… I asked him if he could wittnese yt, and he would not answere, but would have beene runing yt part, and he bad[e] me hear him, and I told him I deny [h]is voyce.

W.C. and W. Emes to M.F., 1661, London [this is by George Fox]
And a P.S. from W. Caton [hand unidentified]

Contents:
"Thine this day I have received, dated in London the 6 [day] of ye first mo. [March, 1660/1], which is noe small refreshing to me in a strange land where wickedness abounds"; her love is dear to him and "in the eternall", he is engaged to her; the Lord has given her a discerning spirit "whereby thou knowest that my sould loveth thee"; "Since I came out of the Palatinate (where I was som time with oure dear Friends there, and was with the Prince [Charles Louis?] who shewed more friendship then ever, but because I doe thinck that my dear bro[ther] W.C. [William Caton] hath given thee an account of passages, I omitt the perticulers), I have travelled through many dominions and through Bohemia, but the power of darkness hath the possession of al[l]. The people are generally slaves within and without. When I have told them of the wickedness of theire priests, they confes it and confes the wickednes of theire rulers, and theire owne wickednes and confes to the Truth, but say they, "we must doe as oure lords will have us or else we may not live here, for we are theirs; we must both doe and beleeve as they will have us', and with this spirit is the multitudes guided...In this citty I have been above 2 weeks...[and] the wickednes is hard to be mentioned. Truth is acknowledged by som[e], but they are not worthy of it. This citty borders upon Poland which is the place intended when I came from the Palatinate, yet not this side of the country. Therefore, tomorrow, I intend to take my journy by water towards Dantzick [Danzig] and that side of Poland which at present lyes upon me. Travilling is difficult...I have an honest man with me, a Friend of Palatine, who could not be cleare to let me pass alone...Love to thy daughter M[argaret Fell, jr] and H.F. [Henry Fell] and the rest of the Friends with thee";

(Postscript from W.C. [William Caton]--"Since the sealeing up of my letter for England, I have even now received this acceptable letter for thee. I tooke speciall care of thine to get it to him though he was farre remote in a strang[e] land, and likewise it was upon me to be diligent in letting him know (according to his yearnest desire) how it was with Friends in England. I have little to acquaint thee with at present besides what I have writt to E.B. [Edward Burrough] which I desire yt thou may have a sight of. Dear W.A. [William Ames] desires me to give dear G[eorge Fox] an account of those thinges which he hath here writt to thee, but of that I shall discharg[e] my selfe by referring it to thee, hopeing that you will not be farre destant at thy receipt hereof. It is my desire very much to hear of Friends in ye North but especially of the dear children who are soe often in my thoughts, yet from none of them doe I hear, neither doe I know very well by whom I shall hear of them, expecting it be thy selfe...Though I have not for some weekes writt perticularly to thee, yet it was my desire that you might see that which I wrote to others"; love to her and to Margrett [Margaret Fell, jr] "and to all thy dear babes at home")

All this is an evidence that he is of councell with ym. And severall of them of ye sep[ar]ation hath been heard to say, what should they doe, or what would become of them, if it were not for Jo[h]n Sto[ry] and Jo[h]n Wilkins[on]. So they want Christ and is like ye preists and professors and all may see (who dwells in ye Light) ye subtilty and deceitt of Jo[h]n Story and that his cause is not good [and] his falsehood and deceit is seen which wee are witnesses of"; (postscript by Thomas Camm- "And yt they of Jo[h]n Story's company of seperation are made upp of drunkerds, tithe payers and other wicked and unfaithfull persons will clearly appear in our relation of them in a reply to their answer to Tho[mas] Langhorne and my paper left in ye South, a coppy whereof we shall endeavor to send to Hartford [Hertford]"); (lengthy postscript by Thomas Dockrey [Dockray]- by these Henry Sweeting "and ye rest may see, whose...tongues are att liberty...and who they are that pleases themselves with talk of righteousness and Truth...and not liveing in itt, and who they are that stands for ye possession of Truth,...and who are in ye wisdome that is from above,...and who they are that is in ye wisdome below,...for truely when G.F.

Endorsed: G.F. answers to ye durty Spirit at Hartford [hand unidentified]: 1678 [hand unidentified]

H.S. [Henry Sweeting] said yt G.F. [George Fox] did say there came a coupple to be marryed, (intimateing also they came to ye seperate Meetting), and one stood up and said, 'Master [John Story, I take such a one to be my wife', and the other stood up and said 'Master Story, I take such a one to be my husband'. Now T[homas] Moss Saith...that G.F. should say there came a couple to a meetting to be marryed to where John Story was present, but doth not say ye Sep[er]ate Meetting, and ye man said, 'M[a]st[er] Story, Master Story' putting off his hatt.

So here ye witnes doth not agree. Againe, see H.S. saith, they went afterward to eat some cake and cheese, and said, 'Sir, I will drink to thee', and doft his hatt, and ye other said, 'Thank you Sir'. Now minde what T.

'they had wine and cakes and ye man putt off his hatt againe and said, here's to you M[a]st[er] Story', but H.S. saith afterwards, they went to eate some cake and cheese and said, 'Sirr, I will drinke to thee' and doft his hatt, and ye other said, 'I thank you Sirr'. Marke H.S. tells not who yt was yt said, 'Sir i will drink to thee' and doft his hat, nor to whom he drank, neither who yt other was that said, 'Thank you Sir'. Marke...T.M. said, 'and when they had done' (but tells not what done), 'they had wine and cakes', and ye man putt off his hatt and said, 'Here's to you M[a]st[er] Story', but speakes nothin of ye other answering, 'thank you Sirr'. So mindle how these 2 wittnesses...are confused"; [the next part is in a different hand; "Thus their paper of lyes they have sent up and down and at the meeting at William Faireman's [Fairman's] house...have discovered many lyars and lyes"; the Lord shall clear the innocent.

He asked her whether it was true [and] ye woman s[ai]d it was true, it grieved her heart to see it. Also he said  yt there was fallen off from John Story thirty at one time of ye honest hearted of ym. These words were spoken by G.F. in my house in Hartford [Hertford] and if G.F. will come to tryall, I shall prove ye substance of wt [what] is above written by other testimonies yt he spoke it in this town in other places"; [the following is the certificate of Edward Perkin]- is writing this "because I have met wth a paper, wherin my name wth others is, yt came from G[eorge] Fox wch is a very abusive paper although he speaks so much of John Story's sending and spreading a paper and not sending to him first"; yet G.F. "hath done it" and should thus be corrected "for this, his great failing"; the following is "in vindication of ye Truth"; came to Henry Sweeting's house in Hartford and "there was G. Fox and ye time I was there I heard him speak ye greatest part of w[ha]t is in a little paper written by H[enry] Sweeting, wch his name is to,...whereof I spoke to Geo. Fox then and asked whereof he related all those miscarriages, to which he would not answer me, and also I asked him about ye woman High Sherriff yt he spake so much of in our publick meeting, and this he referred me to Tho[mas] Robertson"; have never heard "so much spoken by any man yt did profess himself to be a minister of ye gospell...wch indeed I told him then at Henry Sweeting's yt it grieved my heart to hear him relate such things, and so I left him at Henry Sweeting's where I found him in his large goings on...hushing any one yt had any thing to speak besides himself"; [the following certificate is from Mary Beal [Beale]- "Friend G.F., thee hast sent a paper to judg[e] me conserning w[ha]t I heard thee speak about John Story. Thee denies it, but I testify in ye sight of ye Lord yt thee saidst, 'M[aste]r Story I take such an one to be my wife' and 'I take such an one to be my husband', and eat bread and drink wine and goe together like whores and rogues. Thee said I have laid my foundation wth lies, but I have laid it wth ye Light wthin. These words thee spoke at Richard Martin's house. There was Richard Martin and Christopher Taylor and others'; [the following certificate is from Thomas Moss]- notes that at Baldock in Hartford [Hertfordshire], George Fox said, "There came a couple to a meeting to be married where John Story was present and ye man said 'M[aste]r Story, M[aste]r Story,' putting off his hat and w[he]n they had done, they had wine and cakes and ye man put off his hat again and said, 'Here's to you, M[aste]r Story'"

[George Fox] into ye north, Westmoreland [Westmorland], Yorkshere and to Tho[mas] Curtis...about ye matter abovesaid [i.e. about the comments supposedly made by George Fox at Hertford]"; in the paper Henry Sweetting [Sweeting] "saith...yt at his house he heard G.F. say that to ye Sep[ar]ate Meeting of J[ohn] Story, there was whores and roages [rogues], drunkards and swearers etc." also Mary Beale, "a false witntnes" says "in contradiction to H. Sweeting" the following words, "that they eate bread and drinke wine and goe together like whores and roages"; thus, whereas [Henry] Sweeting says "there was whores and roags...to ye Sep[ar]ate Meetting,...M[ary] Beall [Beale] saith they eate bread and drunke...wine and goe together like whores and roages. A plaine contradiction"; also "he saith about ye Sep[ar]ate Meetting and she saith about ye marriage and nothing about ye Sep[ar]ate meetting, so ye wittnesses doth not agree. And Mary Beale saith in ye conclusion of her false testimony yt G.F. spoke these things att Richard Martin's house. where he and Christop[h]er Taylor...was present, which both Richard Martin and Christopher Taylor does utterly deny their hearing of any such things as she hath said"; also Edward Perkin [Parkin] "saith he heard G.F. speak ye greatest p[ar]t of what is written in a pap[er] by Hen[ry] Sweeting...but mentions not what p[ar]t, nor any p[ar]ticuler thing,...and further...saith he asked G.F. wherefore he recited all those mascarriages, to which he [G.F.] would not answere, but in contradiciton to this Henry Sweeting confest in ye meeting at W[illia]m Fairman's house, ye 5 of 8 m. [October], [16]80...that G.F. spoke many things of ye danger of youth runing out before he spok[e] these things, and so G.F. haveing first spoken of ye reason and cause of those things, as Hen[ry] Sweeting confest, what need G.F. say any more of itt"; there is also another contradiction, for Henry Sweeting "said G.F. spoke of ye reasons, to with ye danger of youth...and Ed[ward] Perkin saith he would not answer him"; also Ed[ward] Parken [Parkin] "saith in [the] said paper, although G.F. speakes so much of J[ohn] Story's sending and spreading a pap[er] and not sending to him first, G.F. has done itt and must not hee be corrected for this, his great failing"; the paper "of lyes" was first sent to John Story "and his company in Westm[o]rland and then...sent...into Yorksh[i]re to Samuell Watson, 1st without a name and then after...put 'H.S.' to itt, and likewise it was sent to Tho[mas] Curtis in ye edge of Oxfordsh[i]re and Barksh[i]re [Berkshire] and none of these nor you [those who sent it] sent any to me, but I hearing of your paper spread up and downe and mett with one in Yorksheir, yt was ye cause of my writeing to Hartford to Frends there to speake to you of these things, why you would send ym abroad and not to me first, and therefore this is noe parralell of my sending a paper to Hartford to know ye truth of your sending your paper of lyes abroad and not sending it to me 1st, neither doth G.F. deserve to be corrected for this great fault as thou scoffingly calls it"

I would be glad to know where [were] otherwise now. So would others. If not, I believe G.W. [George Whitehead] will send thy papers to the Quarterly Meeting, who I believe will see and disown thy abuses, both of this meeting [The Second Day's Morning Meeting] at London, particular Friends and themselves and especially ye Truth, wherein they are concerned and wherein they labour and travail, though therein thou abusively comparest them to ye abuses of Bishops, orders, constitutions, decrees, canons, cheating, and other terms I cannot now remember, nor thou understand, else thou wouldest write them in truer English and better sence. This I mention to me[et] with an[d] abate thy conceitednes to help thee with Spectacles [for the point of these repeated references to Spectacles, see De Christiana Libertate etc., p. 163] to se[e] how unfitt thou art to undertake to be a judge of learning in that kinde as well as to be a judge of such Friends in Truth and such meetings of Friends...in imperiously and menacingly requiring them to advise and consent to ye altering ye Quarterly Meetting Book in your parts, as if thou hadst both this an[d] that meeting at thy devotion, either to bend to thy hand at thy pleasure or else to undoe by thy publication"; warning to turn from "that nature thou art in"; "Thy lies and revilings are not worth answering, to be like thee, they are so gross and vain. Thy queries [see De Christiana Libertate etc., pp.153-164] differ in ye principle from which they proceed and ye end to which they tend...Conceit hath so blinded ye, thou canst neither see beginning nor endning. If I did not see thy perverse, wilfull, gross lies, I should answer to thy ignorance"

Sends love along with wife, mother and sister; writing this “to lett thee understand that yesterday, being ye 21st of this instant, there came into our meeting a younge man and brought a booke of W[illia]m Jones, sen[iour] and W[illia]m Dyer, sen[iour]. It was ye 7th part of yt wich is called ‘Ye Apostate and Innovater’ [The Seventh Part of the Christian Quaker; Wing R1862]. It was a great greif to honest Friends to have it, soe we bear[e]d our testimoney agt it and desired ye abovesd promoters to put a stopt to it, for I tould them the Friends concerned was not there, but it was never ye near, they would goe on in their worke of mischeife. I told them yt ye booke had a tendancy to bring Friends into sufferings, there being some of ye people of the world there, and I did acquainte them that it was never Friends practice to read such great contentious books in meetings. They had never any example from us,… and I tould them it was not Friends practice to read a booke at ye begining of a meeting and soe hold on reading almost to ye end. The reader heave not been at our meeting, not above 3 or 4 times I belive this 12 months. I suppose he scarsely ownes himselfe by ye name of a Quaker. The abovesd promoters said they did own ye booke, and would stand by it. W[illia]m Dyer said it was a hew [hue] and cry; it’s sport for him and soe I told ihm, but I told them ye Lord would clear ye Innocent in His time. Oh, ye wicked things yt they heave writ agt thee, dear G.F. [George Fox]. They read the Friends names in ye book, but I heave forgotten all, but thee art ye cheifest”; wished wholeheartedly “yt Friends names had been to yt booke wch is called ‘Ye Accuser of our Bretherne’ [George Whitehead, The Accuser of our Brethren Cast Down; Wing W1887]. If antient Friends names had been to it, as G[eorge] Whitehead’s, Elexander [Alexander] Parker’s and W[illia]m Gibson’s and W[illia]m Penn’s, he being a popular man, it had been I belive a meanes to heave weig[h]ed down this spirit. I am for ye hands of Friends and harts agt this Sp[iri]t, for it is a Sp[iri]t yt tends to all manner of loosness and ye Lord’s name is prophaned by them amongst professors,… and I know not why Friend[s] should be afraide of their names. They are God’s enemies and His peoples enemies and ye worst they ever met wth I belive since they made a profesion of ye Truth. I would to God all was vallient agt them. Our exercise have been sore wth this opposeing Sp[iri]t”; however, “it is bt our meeting at Chippenham yt is soe mcuh disturb[ed] wth them. Friends be prety clear of yt Sp[iri]t in most meetings in our c[o]untry, onely there is one standing sepperate meeting which I supose thee knowest of yt is at Sutton,… but Friends are clear of them. I understand there is but few follows them. They have very small meeting[s]. Yt meeting was cheifly sett up by N[athaniel] Coleman and Jo[h]n Jenings [Jennings]. God’s power is over them all and I doe not question but God’s power is over them all and I doe not question but yt in time this Sp[iri]t will be quite woren out”; (Postscript- “Francis Brown, one of their preachers was at ye meeting. He never preacht nor pray[e]d, neither did he indeavor to put a stop to ye reading of [that] [w]icked, ungodly booke, bt harked to it very dilligently, and I belive taken with it” he is a “gross lyer”)

Contents: Has read “thy disdainfull letter to Friend’s meeting on 2d day morning” and wonders “what splendor thou couldst thou see in it? Outward thou couldst not,…inward thou couldst not”; see Ps[alms] 123:4; seeing that “thou wouldst have me to write to thee, I must do it to thy kinde. They send for no books to be read by them and if they be sent, may they not? They compel none to print their alterations, nor to print where they will without them and their approbation, and none can compel…them to yt. What then doest thou snarle at? That they will not approve thy writing what thou listest to direct the persecutors?... Is tha[t] ye message and warning to ye people yt thou speakest of? And therefore it seems thou art vexed agt ye Yearly Meeting also, and that persecutors and persecutions should be manifested and ye nation warned agt it from ye judgm[en]ts manifest ag[ains]t it, or that any relief should bee afforded in ye nation, either from it or under it to  ye poor and oppressed, but swel[l] and burst asunder in ye midst. Thou canst not abate that mutual care. No tyrant ever found a greater torment than envy. Gnaw thy tongue at it, that ye righteous are keept in a lasting remembrance, even those whom thou deceitfully seemst to esteem, citing their names and works p[er]verted to thy advantage and to dishonourest them”; his impudence and hypocrisy “appear to every discerning eye in being affronted that an equal care is used in recording ye appearances of God’s owning their testimony in our time and place as other churches have done in their time and place, yet professing thy self a promoter of ye testimony with them of a further appearance of God…in ours than was in theirs. Doth not thy indignation then, like that in Joh[n] 12 proceed from…pride, envy…hypocrisy, baggageness (lessening ye testimony not augmenting it…),…for Ba-Bu-Be-gree is ye e[nd? Where?] to such things tend, destruction…to be destroyed…Read ye Scriptures in ye margin whereto I allude allegorically”; [The Scriptural references are badly smeared, but appear to be as follows- 2 Pet[er] 2:12, Jud[e] 10, Rev[elation] 11:18, Phil[ippians] 3:19, 2 Cor[inthians] 11:15]

Abstract: 243. A True Account of one Solomon Hornoul, that lately went in Sack-Cloath, through parts of London, Westminster, and Southwark, etc., from the People called Quakers and from his kindred. London, the 23d day of the 3d [this has been changed in ink from 2d, but an examination of other copies of this pamphlet shows the same change] month [May], 1685. Printed. pp.2. 31 cm [Wing T2338]
Contents: [Begins with a description of Hornoul]; notes he "hath sometime since taken upon him the name of Honywood, a great family in Essex", and pretends to be "a Cambridge schollar"; his father "was sometimes a keeper of cattle for Collonel Mildmay in Dengey [Dengie] Hundred in Essex", while his mother "now liveth poorly at Ratcliff with his brother, a porter"; Solomon was "sometimes a driver of cattle out of...Dengey hundred to London [and] pretends that he was tryed for his life at Edmonsbury [Bury St Edmunds], in Suffolk before Judge [Sir William] Montague [Montagu] for pretended treasonable words or preaching", but was sent for to London where he appeared "before the late King Charles the Second and his council" and was acquitted and given licence to preach, "the latter of which is a notorious forged lye"; he also pretends to have been "in the Inquisition", and that "it cost his father 10,000 pounds to get him out, and that Sir Josiah Child remitted the money, another forged lye"; he also "pretends to prophesise of sword, pestilence, famine and fire on London,...and on the 24th of the last month [April], he went through Leaden-Hall [Leadenhall] Street in his sackcloth coat...pro-nouncing judgments,...but was near Aldgate detected by one that knew him and his deceit"; then on the 14th instant [of the 3rd month i.e. May], he "went down the Strand in like manner, pretending a messuage to the King"; for about five years he has been "a vagabond, idle, lazy, cheating fellow in many parts of England"; on the 24th of January, 1683/4 "he made his escape from Chester goal...and hath sometimes been reputed a Jesuit and sometimes a Quaker, though never in society with Quakers, or owned by them"; he left his wife "who had been a victualler's servant-maid in Bishopgate [Bishopsgate] Street, whose name is Thomas Powel [Powell] and liveth at the sign of the Bull, but she is since dead, and he hath falsly pretended he had married another of great fortune, which is another lye, and in his letter to N.B. [Nathaniel Brassey], a goldsmith in Lumbard [Lombard] Street, dated "Yarmouth Goal, 23d of March', the said Solomon confesses his own deceitful works and ways", and asks for help and promises that "'if ever I do come to London again, you shall never know the same evils by me'"; however he is not to be trusted
: [On side two is a testimony against Solomon Hornoul, signed by his brother, William Hornoul and dated "London, this 24 day of January 1683/4", and which is witnessed in the presence of William Gibson, Nathaniel Brassey, Richard Whitepain [Whitpaine] notes that Solomon is the son of the late William Hornoul and was born in Chesterton parish near Cambridge, from which his father moved to Dengey [Dengie] parish; refutes the claim [by Solomon] that "our father was a Knight", or that he [Solomon] "is a Cambridge schollar"; also, "I have seen a letter this day writ[ten] by R.S. [Richard Starkey], dated 'West-Chester', the 18th instant [of the 11th month i.e. January, 1683/4; for this letter written from Starkey to William Gibson, see The Original Records of Sufferings, n.368; see also numvers 232 and 369 in that collection for more on this episode], wherein he adviseth that my brother Solomon desired liberty of the Justices at the Sessions to write to one Alderman Powel, who (as he saith) lives at the Sign of the Bull within Bishops-gate" who would prove he was the son of a living Knight and was married to a wealthy woman; in fact, "I know no Alderman Powel alive at this day, but we have a kinsman, whose name is Tho[mas] Powel [Powell] who keeps a victualling house" but was never an Alderman; as for his [Solomon's] wife, she "is deceased, and he had no portion with her that I know of", nor has he married an heiress, and as for calling "himself 'Solomon Hornoul Honeywood [Honywood]', I say his name is 'Solomon Hornoul [the modern spelling would probably be Hornell]', not "Honeywood'"; [ends with a description of his brother]
: [On side two is another certificate, signed by Thomas Powell, dated "London, the 24th day of January, 1683/4", and witnessed by Nathaniel Brassey and William Hornoul] - notes receiving a letter "from my cousin Solomon Hornoul, dated 'Cheshire, January 16th, 1683[4]', by the hands of Mr. Egerton of Blooms-bury [Bloomsbury] requesting me to give a true account of his father, and that his brother [William] and I might write to clear him to the Justices and to send our letters to Sir Phillip Egerton"; agrees with what his brother [William] has written [see above] "and I have certified so much to Mr Egerton"; had advised him [Solomon] "to leave this idle, wicked course of living and settle to work, and he told me that he could not work", but intended to live "by his wits"

Wrote to him formerly “but as yett have received no answer, wch makes mee doubt ye miscarriage of mine”; for the present, “wee have not im[m]ediate opportunitie to send to England by reason there is no setled trade thither, wch notwithstanding may conveniently bee effected in its proper season, here being com[m]odities as tobaccos, oyle, hides and tallow to transport thither, and Holland’s busses [vessels used to fish herring] may come in safely of about 150 tunn, drawing about 9 foot [of] water. The cuntry produces plentifully with as little labour as any I have knowe, all things necessary for ye life of man. It wants only industrious people fearing God. Wee at present have peace wth all ye nations of ye indians, and the great fatt King of ye Tuskiroroes [Tusoaroras] was not long since with me haveing had an indian slaine in these partes” and having been informed “it was by the English”; however, on inquiry, “I found out ye murtherer...was a Chewan [Chowan] indian, one of their great men’s sons, whom I im[m]ediately order[e]d to bee apprehended, but ye Chewan indians bought his life of ye Tuskiroroes King for a great quantity of Wamp[um] and peage. This Tuskiroroe King was very desirous to cutt of[f] a nation of indians called ye Matchepungoes [Machapungas] wch I have at present prevented and hope I shall leave ye cuntry att peace wth all ye indians and one with another”; however the people “are very fearful of falling in to some troubles againe if I should leave ym before my bro[ther] [Seth] Sothell [Sothel, governour of the Carolinas] returnes, wch makes my stay ye longer. This Tuskiroroe King seems to bee a very wise man as to naturall parts. Some of ye indians neare mee are so civilized as to come into English habits and have cattle of their owne, and I looke upon their outward civilizing as a good preparation for ye Gospell”; only wish that “all yt had knowne itt had been faithfull”, for God “forsakes none butt the unfaithfull”; “What I writt unto yee in my former I can[n]ot butt againe repeat wch is a desire to bee had in remembrance by yee, haveing a faith in ye power yt was by yee in this last age of ye world first preached and convinced mee in ye begining and separated mee from my father’s house”; wishes that “these partes had binn more visited by Friends...[but] ye im[m]ediate sence and growth of ye divine Seed is encouragement to all yt witness the same”; 
(Postscript—sends love to Friends and to Geo[rge] Keith “whose books of ye way to ye citty of God [The Way to the city of God described (1678); Wing K235] hath binn very serviceable unto mee”; love to Geo[rge] Whitehead and William Meade)

The Lord allmighty keep them faithfull to Himself and...support them"; they send their love "unto thee and other Friends in England"; love to he and Friends also from Jan Claus, Jan Roelofs, B[arent] van Tongeren, Abraham Roosen and their wives "and alsoe my wife's [Elizabeth]"

Notes: Had hoped "that John Hitchcock should be the bearer of the inclosed, but it came a littel to[o] late, beeing departed from Rotterdam, from whence it is again come to my hands", and since which time "we have thine without datum" and which was read at "our 14 days meeting"; "We are very willing to communicate thy Latyn [Latin] bo[o]kes which thou thoughts to send us by George Hyam, to the Ambassaduers gathered from severall Princes in the Hage [Hague], as also to send them to severall other places and disperse them where we shall have occasion, but we kan [can] do nothing before th[e]y are come to our hands which is not yet, and therefore we shall expect them"; Friends there and in other places are pretty well, "but att Dantzigh [Danzig], th[e]y begin there again to threatten Friends. The Burgemaster [Burgomaster] Constantyn [Constantine] Ferber [Faber] did sent [send] the 9 of the 4 mo. [June] 3 messengers to their meeting which did say that th[e]y had ordres to bring some out of the midst of them to t[h]e Burgemaster, and soo th[e]y tooke with them 2 men that comes som[e]times to the meeting, and it seems that th[e]y are in measure convinced (saying of Nicolas [Nicholas] Rust and Michel [Michael] Mugge, them two are us sure enough, we can have them when we please)"; when the two men appeared before the Burgemaster he asked one, "whose name is Claus Quire, of his trade, a sayemaker [sailmaker?]:, and also asked him "from what geneneration [generation] he was", who answered, "of the Mennists [Mennonites], and that he was living not under his, but under another government, and so he let him alone, and was going away, and turn[e]d...to the other, Hans Slicher, being a husbandman, and did ask him, from what generation, or...what religion he was, and he did answer, "From Luther", whereupon he [the Burgomaster] appeared amazed, "saying 'from Lutherus?...Wilt thou go over to such a divilish faith?', saying further, 'If thou continuest going ther[e], then I shall proceed after another way with thee and bring thee to a place which shall not be well pleased unto thee', and did further command to the messenge[rs] to be diligent in their inspection"; what will happen further, "we must expect"; have since "written to them. The Lord allmighty keep them faithfull to Himself and...support them"; they send their love "unto thee and other Friends in England"; love to he and Friends also from Jan Claus, Jan Roelofs, B[arent] van Tongeren, Abraham Roosen and their wives "and alsoe my wife's [Elizabeth]"

Abstract: 240. [On side one is the following note, probably relating to the Meeting for Sufferings, dated the 6th month [August]. 1682, - "Agreed, that the writings and bookes etc., public and private, relating to the service of Truth and Friends sufferings, that are in Th[omas] Rudyard's hands be delivered to Tho[mas] Lacy, to be keept by him for ye Meeting of 12, for ye service of Truth. Geo[rge] Whitehead and W[illia]m Gibson are desired...[to] take care about it and John Dew and W[illia]m Chandler"; this is slightly torn]; [On side two are several items; first is a brief examination of the proper translation of a word used in Ezek[iel] 6:6, as follows- "Idols are called Gillulei, which is by some, as Junius [probably Franciscus Junius, the Elder], translated Stercorei dei, and he on that place notes how much God and His servannts abhor ye very seats of...Dungy Gods; [Ezekiel], Ch. 4:12, ...it's translated, 'man's dung'; Deut[eronomy] 29:17 [where the term 'idols' is used]. Junius and [John Immanuel] Tremelius [Tremellius] and ye last translators in ye marg[in?] render Gillulei [as] 'dungy Gods'"; also in "Isay [Isaiah] 46:1, 'your idolls were upon ye beasts, your carriages heavy laden'"; the second part of side two deals with a rhyme apparently entitled "A Case for [Francis] Bugg's spectacles" [see p.163 of Bugg's De Christiana Libertate, or Liberty of Conscience; Wing B5370]; this is a rough draft of the rhyme, which includes the term 'dungy Gods', which is probably the reason for the examination of the term in the first part of side two; the final version of the rhyme can be found in number 229, and is also printed in Robert Sandilands' Righteous Judgment Placed, p. 97; Wing S661]; finally there is mention of "3 Edw[ard] I, c.34, slanderous news"]

Contents: [See also number 236 in which Anne Docwra disowns this paper and also see number 245 which is identical, although with different manuscript additions than those in this copy; see below]; "Many days and some months it hath been with me to write a few lines concerning the debates and contests which have been frequent of late years, and still remain amongst some people professing Truth about their OUTWARD FORMS, DIRECTORIES, and such like things" [Capitals are those of the author]; [this paper continues for 4 quarto sides generally attacking those who force others to follow such rules and regulations; there are numerous additions made in brackets, two of which are as follows- "If any professing the Truth, as it is in JESUS, should either directly or indirectly discountenance or weaken the hands of any in THIS their work and service, they are looked upon [by them of G.F.'s party] as not to be in unity with the Church of Christ and order of the Gospel"; this appears on side one and 'G.F.' refers to George Fox; "I desire in the love of GOD, that ALL may beware of THOSE [G. Whitehead, T. Elwood, etc] that of late years have printed and published books to vindicate their FORMALITIES and Directories (and to detect and defame their Opposers)"; this is one side three and 'G. Whithead' refers to George Whitehead, while 'T. Elwood' refers to Thomas Ellwood; all words in capitals are those of the author]; [the paper ends with a lengthy poem and with the following note- "That those few words between crotchets (in the foregoing paper) are not the authors, but added by an approver thereof, who apprehending it to be very serviceable and acceptable to many honest Friends, caus'd it to be thus reprinted"
: There are also lengthy manuscript additions in the margins by an unknown hand- "Ann Docwra, art thee and W.R. [William Rogers] and T.C. [Thomas Crisp] and F.B. [Francis Bugg] and J.A. [John Aynsloe] and J[ohn] Peneman [Pennyman] and R[obert] Rich and such like in Sion's peace and J.W. [John Wilkinson] etc, have you shewed forth ye fruits of Sion's peace and ye Light and grace of God in y[o]ur hearts by your fruits in printing and scibleing, especially those before mentioned, some with lieing, defameing books agt ye faithful...as tho[ugh] their consciences were se[a]red with hot irons, and spread them up and down this nation and beyond sea to priests, justices and mayors who are ready to tear us in peices. And who would ever have thought Ann Dowcra would have appeared in publick agt ye faithfull. Many took thee for a wiser woman then to joyn with ye publi[c] opposers agt God's people in print...If ever that humble motion come to be raised in thee that thou speakest of, thou will fell thou hast laid upon thyself a heavy burthen and thou hast a great crop of lies and fals[e]hoods wch thou hast sown in print, in whom their is...more malice than matter and thou will not escape ye judgements of God for wronging, belieing and defameing His people in print. Thou hadst better have studdyed to be quiet and have kept down that unruly, willfull, ravenous sp[iri]t and have...power over that before thou had set up thyself...in print and usurped authority...Thou hadst better...call in thy printed paper againe, for it is of noe credit to them that fear God, and many sober people that have an esteem for thee. Indeed some heady, willfull and unruly sp[iri]t may be puft up to their own destruction by it and not to thy salvation, for thou hast not shewed any inward sence of ye love of God wch thou speakes of in page ye 1st, but a root of bitterness. Truly Ann, I was grieved for thee when I see thy books and many others and see soe many false reflections in them upon ye suffering people of God wch will strengthen ye evill doers and encourage them who appears like a publick enemy and adversary in print agt ye suffering Lambs of Xt in this day of persecution"; she has shown "more malice than matter and [a] presumption to judge of things thou understands not, but with what judgm[en]t thou judgest and measure thou measurest thou mayest expect it againe from ye Lord. But hath not thou given J.A. ye lie and also J.A. himself? Read his book [Several Things Given Forth; Wing A4296] of not judging and ye church laying in ye bosom of Xt. How contrary doe yee act one to another and he to himself, like T[homas] Crisp's Babill [Babel's Builders; Wing C6948] and your books are spread in ye world among priests, professor and profaine and with your books have strengthened our persecutors and ye rude rabble agt us, and your work sufficiently discovers you to be enemies of Sion's peace, but God...will rewarde you according to your works and many of you had better never to have been born...I desire thee repent and be humble and call [in thy?] book againe. Ann, this is thy owne condition who are in such a rage agt ye innocent and faithfull people of God who are clear of all thy false charges and the rimes in thy book and th[ou] had a great deal better have studyed to be quiet"

Abstract: 245. Ann Dowcra: A Brief Discovery of the Work of the Enemy of Sion's Peace, Written in True Love, to the end that all may return to the Inward Teaching of the Blessed Light and Grace of God in their own Hearts and Consciences. Cambridg [Cambridge], the sixth Month called August, 1683. Printed. pp. 4. 21cm. [Wing D1777b]

Contents: [See also number 236 in which Ann Dowcra disowns this paper, and see number 237 which is identical with this, although with different manuscript additions; however the additions in both these pamphlets are in the same hand, although in this copy a different hand has added the intials 'G.F.' [George Fox] on the first page, although it is highly unlikely that he is the author of these additions]; [the Manuscript additions]- "Ann, thou sayest 'in true love' etc., page first, and 'them of G.F.'s [George Fox's] party' etc. These are scoffing words, if thou owns them, for G.F. turns people to ye Light and soe to Xt [Christ]. Any may see these words are malicious and not from true love, nor ye love of God, nor a humble motion, and then thou...saist, 'their outward forms, directoryes' and then thou art at it againe- 'their directories were at first subscribed to, but by a few'. These are scoffing words. Thou thinkest to put us in ye bare skin to set ye dogs to whory us, but what ate ye names of them yt did ever subscribe to 'directoryes' at ye first or last and what are those 'directoryes and formes', and what year was that 'first'? Thou speakest soe confidently of 'blind zeal and rigid devotion' and 'imaginary wisdome', 'makeing clean ye outside of ye cup and platter', 'outward rules and contrivances of fal[len] man', 'outward orders and directoryes', 'directoryes or any outward rules or prescriptions', and thou art at it againe, page 3, G.W. [George Whitehead] and T.E. [Thomas Ellwood] publish 'books to vindecate their formalityes and directoryes', those 'fig leaf garments', 'fig leaf excuses', 'Babil's Tower', his directoryes, who hast made an idol and clamours and fights agt it, but Ann, all these words are not from 'true love' nor 'charity' nor 'true humility', but from a tongue yt abuses God's people with base language and belies them and God's people and many sober people doe look upon J.S. [John Story] and J.W. [John Wilkinson] and W.R. [William Rogers], R.R. [Robert Rich] and J.P. [John Pennyman] and F.B. [Francis Bugg], their tongues noe slander, and doth thou own G[eorge] Whitehead and T[homan] Ellwood, their books 'stufft [stuffed] with sophistry, and such like curious arts'? Dost thee own these venomous tongues under wch is ye poison of aspes to dislocaye and make void any sincere men? Truly this work doth shew forth an 'out...side clean cup'nor'platter' nor 'true love' nor ye 'love of God' nor a 'humble motion' nor 'charity', but ye fruit discovers the trees. Thou saist, 'looking upon themselves as ye guardians of other men's sp[iri]tualls and temporalls'. These are base and false reflections to come  out of thy mouth, and have been answered long agoe and what 'order', 'directory', 'prescriptions' yt is 'contrary to ye Light, grace and gospell of Xt', all that are fal[le]n into ye temptation of ye Devill never brought forth a katalogue of them yet, who imposed their marriages and other things upon us, wch we in tenderness of conscience neve[r] could set our hands unto, and therefore because we could not own ye things imposed upon us, they have broken forth into print outragious and become heady, high-minded and fierie dispisers of them yt are good, and therefore we are turned away from such who never to this day did set forth a katalogue of their own 'directoryes', 'formes', 'prescriptions', and 'orders',...but yt are turned into a land of darkness without order, wrestless and disquieted sp[iri]ts like a rageing wave of ye sea, casting out mire and dirt, fomeing out their own shame in their scribling and printing books, but there is noe peace to ye wicked, but He will grow worse and worse. Remember, it was told you and therefore take heed lest thou be worse, wch I desire thou may be better, for thou, wch hast stigmatized, marked, branded and belied and villifyed and defamed God's people with ye rest, in print in their Xtian reputation, [nor] wou[ld] not spare, if you had power, to take away their lives, for your wrath is like Caine's [Cain's] and your gainesaying like Corah's [Korah's], who are turned like ye informers to inform agt God's people to destroy them in your books, but God's protecting power in wch He preserves His people is over you all and it would be very well if thou finds a place of repentance"

Contents:
On the 27th of the 11th month [January] 1681[2], “I was att our Freinds meeting att Bristoll [Bristol] amongst ye peaceable people of God called Quakers”; shortly after beginning to speak, “some of [the] world’s people came near unto ye place where they might hear [and] I then spoke to them tenderly”, exhorting them, among other things, to believe in the Light “which leads out of death and darkness to God, from whence it comes”; however, “two men came, and one very much in hast[e] with his hand lifted up tooke me by ye arme and said I must goe with him, and I said “I desire to speak a little more, and you may hear and bear wittness agtt me if I speak not ye Truth’, but he would not, but put mee and another Friends (viz) W[illia]m Prigg, into a house for sometime till he had taken ye names of ye rest of our Friends, and tehn they tookes us out of yt house and had us to Newgate [in Bristol], and thence att night wee were had before Alderman [Ralph] Oliffe and some other magistrat[e]s or officers of ye city, and one John Hellyer [Hellier] (w[he]n they had informed im yt I did preach att ye meeting) asked mee by w[ha]t authority I cam to preach there [and] I answered, ‘By ye authority of Jesus Christ, and I came to bear wittness to ye Truth according as I had received of ye spirit’, and some said yt was canting, and I said, ‘Except ye same Spirit be in yout [you] yt raised up Jesus Christ from ye dead, ye are none of His’ and one said wee tooke up to[o] high a degree upon us [the Quakers], for priests now are higher then they were under ye Law, and I answered yt ye disciples and ministers of Christ were to be meek and lowly, and as ye Apostle said servants to all for Christ sake. ‘Ay but’, saith he, “...you intrude yourselves, and Uzza touched ye Arke and he was smitten yt he died’, and I answered, yt ye Ark was set on a new cart and carried by two milch kind wch lowed as they went and yt ye Arke shaked but our heavenly Arke Christ Jesus yt is on His way never shakes and need no fleshly arm to support Him”; however, also has something “of an outward concern to lay before you”; was informed by a report “yt, I mett wth, yt ye ship yt my son was in was took to Argier [Algiers], and seing ye Bishop [William Gulston] did not do his office,… for a Bishop is an overseer, but he not releving them of Bristoll yt are in captivity,… was a concern in my mind, having a fatherly repeck to see after him”; they then “read me ye Oxford Act 17 Cr.2, c.2] and said yt I must be be kept in prison six monthes unless I would pay £40 for preaching, and I said it was an unreasonable request to demand £40 of me for preaching, when some gitt so many forty pounds for preaching, and they said, ‘You have no ye knack of it’, and… Alderman Oliffe said, ‘We have nothing but trouble with you for our parts’, and I said ‘Jerusaleme is a burthensome stone’, and so they gave me mind to drink, and one said, he beleived I was an honest man, and being but one Justice they sent for another, but none came so they could not comitt me by one Justice, but told ye gaoler yt he must have us away and we must be brought to [the] Tolsey [Tolzey] ye next day, which was done, and I only brough[t] to ye Tolsey befor[e] ye Mayor [Sir Thomas Earle] and Bishop [William Gulston] and other magistrates, where as (I suppose) by reason of ye Bishop, who seemed to be very angery and so ye first Mittimus [warrants of committal] was laid by and ye Bishop said, ‘I am glad I have mett yo[u] here; I will amek you fast enough’, and he would take a course wth me, and yt he would have me whipts, and I said, ‘I value not a pin ye worst yt thee canst doe’. And I said yt a Bishop must not be soon angry and he must be no striker, and so they proferred me ye Oath [of Allegiance] and I must swear, and I tould them I could not swear, for cons[c]ience sake…, and then they asked me from whence I came wth me, and I answered yt I came alone out of Westmoreland [Westmorland] and yt I lived in ye parish of Kendall [Kendal] w[he]n I was in ye countrey. Then they said, ‘You would be a Bishop’. I said, ‘He yt desires ye office of a Bishop desires a good work’,… and then I spoke as I spoke ye night before, yt I came to bear wittness to ye Truth and yt ye Bishop did not take care of ye people of Bristoll yt are in Argier [Algiers] as an overseer should, that so if it were possible my son might be redeemed if he were in captivity and now I am like for so doing to go into a hold yt if I were in Argier might be sooner redeemed then I am like to be here, and so you make your city an Argier, and they asked me whose apprentice my son was, and I said he was Charles Halford’s [Harford’s] 7 years and going into 8 his facotr and others,… to ye King’s [Charles II] Custome Office he hath brough[t] several years above £1,000 a year for goods yt have gone through his hands. And ye Bishop and ye Mayor asked me questions [such as] w[ha]t age I was, and when I tooke ye Sacrem[en]t and some asked me w[he]n I tooke ye Sacrem[en]t of ye Eucarist [Eucharist]. I said, ‘I have not head such words used in England but as they were brought out of France and Spain’, and then they said I was a Jesuite and tooke ye cap of[f] my head to see if I was not shaven and one said he had seen me beyond ye seas and I told him I was never beyond ye sea, so the Bishop asked whether I had taken ye Sacrem[en]t for 20 or 30 years and I said, ‘When I was young I took ye Sacrament, as you call it, but not of late, for ye Scarament is not in ye Scriptures and I am a true Christian Protestant’, and I asked the Bishop if he had gone to Church all this 30 yeeres past, and he said ‘yes’, and then I said ye Bishop had turned his coat, and ye people laughed and he satt downe,… and after they had cryed ‘Sylence’, ye Bishop stood up againe and said, ‘Do you not think yt there was an Episcopalian Church in Oliver’s [Oliver Cromwell’s] dayes’? And I said ‘If there was such a church, they never told us of it nor sent us neither epistle nor gospell, but left us to devourers and Presbiters and ye like’. Then ye sherife [either Richard Lane or John Knight] s[ai]d I was an honest fellow, and I asked ye Bishop why he did not come to preach to us, and some siad, ‘You would not have him preach to you’, and I said, “We would have him come and preach to us, and if wee like his preaching better then wee do our owne, wee will receive it’, but he said he would have me whipt, and he would keep me fast enough, and I said if I perished in prison my blood should ly at his doore, and he said that it should not and yet he hath signed my Mittimus, and I s[ai]d that ‘You can suffer ballad singers in your streets to gather great companyes togeather, but if we meet togeather to wait upon ye Lord and ex[h]orte people to live in His feare, we must bee spoyled and badly used’, and ye mayor s[ai]d, ‘I should see the[e] whipt’, and I told him they should first be spoaken to and informed, and he asked me where I was last Sunday, as hee caled it, and I s[ai]d ‘Kensham [Keynsham]’, and he asked me other questions, as about preaching or such like, and I said, ‘If any man had anything against me, I was there to make my answer and I need not accuse my selfe’, and the Maior s[ai]d yt I answered well, and so they had me away and signed the Mittimus with 7 seales and the Bishop one of them”

Also the use of the word "shee" seems ti imply Elizabeth Hooton although the latter, at age 52, might be more inclined to have a "rume" in the eyes then Aldam who was then about 36] -"I shall of God doe permitt write next Saturday to my brother Richard Farneworth [Farnworth] to come to yee wth all speede; he is carried forth up and downe about ye worke of ye Lord.

If hee have falsely imprisoned thee, thou may take a course wth him at law. The law is, if any transgresse ye Law of ye Commonwealth, ye plantiffe against him may give over when hee will, hee hath moe more to doe wth it. Thou mayst aske this lawyer if it bee not soe’. ‘Frend [retorted Aldam], art thou a minister of Christ and ownes the law to bee equall and accordinge to that in the conscience, to cast one in prison above two yeares and when yt time is past, to out ye man out of prison wthout haveinge any tryall beefore ye contry’?, But hee sayd hee was not to pleade the law, but away hee went from mee”; however, “I was returned of a jury and a baliffe came and gave mee notice and told mee if I did not serve [on the jury] I should bee fined, soe to the gaoler I went and told them yt I was commanded by authoritie from ye powres of ye nation to doe service of a jurye,…and I was returned foreman, as they sayd and I desired…to goe throughe them to doe service, but their answere was, they would not suffer mee, soe I writt to the Judge yt I might receive justice from him to “give order to the gaoler to let mee come to serve, or free mee from issues, but his answere was, if I would petition in their forme hee would, but to that I had written, hee would not. Hee stumbled much at the word ‘Frend’, wch was the first word and hee did often repeate it. ‘Thy brother writes the first word ‘Frend’. Is this to bee spoken to a judge? Goe thy way’. Upon the 22th day I was called and it was soe yt the prison dore was open and they was vryeinge my name at the Crosse in the Castle garth, and soe I stepped to the jurye and cryer and made my appearance and went to the gaoler, desireinge I might goe on wth the jurye and I should take a souldier wth mee, and it was granted, and comeinge to the Bench, I spoke to the Judge” [the next part begins on number 113]- ‘Frend, I require justice of thee. I am here returned of a jury and am free to doe service. Either suffer mee to goe on in service or quitt mee from issues’.”; however “his mouth was stopped yt I did not heare him speake, but the baliffes cryed ‘Take of[f] his hatt’, and ‘Take him away’, cryed others, and soe they putt my hatt of[f] wth one of their staves [and] others leyd hands of mee, but the judge [Sir Richard] Newdigate did not gainsay yt”; moved quickly to place where the judge sat ‘and spoke to the under sherriffe [George Mancklin?], hee beeinge frendly…[and] I sayd, ‘Frend, what was ye Judge[‘s] answere?

It is thy earthly spirit out of wch ariseth feare,…’ but hee sayd, ‘Frend wee shall not despute here’, and away hee would have beene gone, but hee did promisse much and sayd hee would speake to the judges and justices to quit mee for ye prisoninge by ye presit and to see the fine taken of[f]. Now sayd I , ‘Frend, dost thou owne such a law as is now pracktised uppon mee, who have beene two yeares and two months in prison and never come to a tryall…?’”; but he said,”’ The law is open. If hee have falsely imprisoned thee, thou may take a course wth him at law. The law is, if any transgresse ye Law of ye Commonwealth, ye plantiffe against him may give over when hee will, hee hath moe more to doe wth it. Thou mayst aske this lawyer if it bee not soe’. ‘Frend [retorted Aldam], art thou a minister of Christ and ownes the law to bee equall and accordinge to that in the conscience, to cast one in prison above two yeares and when yt time is past, to out ye man out of prison wthout haveinge any tryall beefore ye contry’?, But hee sayd hee was not to pleade the law, but away hee went from mee”; however, “I was returned of a jury and a baliffe came and gave mee notice and told mee if I did not serve [on the jury] I should bee fined, soe to the gaoler I went and told them yt I was commanded by authoritie from ye powres of ye nation to doe service of a jurye,…and I was returned foreman, as they sayd and I desired…to goe throughe them to doe service, but their answere was, they would not suffer mee, soe I writt to the Judge yt I might receive justice from him to “give order to the gaoler to let mee come to serve, or free mee from issues, but his answere was, if I would petition in their forme hee would, but to that I had written, hee would not. Hee stumbled much at the word ‘Frend’, wch was the first word and hee did often repeate it. ‘Thy brother writes the first word ‘Frend’. Is this to bee spoken to a judge? Goe thy way’. Upon the 22th day I was called and it was soe yt the prison dore was open and they was vryeinge my name at the Crosse in the Castle garth, and soe I stepped to the jurye and cryer and made my appearance and went to the gaoler, desireinge I might goe on wth the jurye and I should take a souldier wth mee, and it was granted, and comeinge to the Bench, I spoke to the Judge” [the next part begins on number 113]- ‘Frend, I require justice of thee. I am here returned of a jury and am free to doe service. Either suffer mee to goe on in service or quitt mee from issues’.”; however “his mouth was stopped yt I did not heare him speake, but the baliffes cryed ‘Take of[f] his hatt’, and ‘Take him away’, cryed others, and soe they putt my hatt of[f] wth one of their staves [and] others leyd hands of mee, but the judge [Sir Richard] Newdigate did not gainsay yt”; moved quickly to place where the judge sat ‘and spoke to the under sherriffe [George Mancklin?], hee beeinge frendly…[and] I sayd, ‘Frend, what was ye Judge[‘s] answere? Didst thou heare him speake’? Hee sayd, Yes, the judge sayd hee would fine ye gaoler for lettinge mee come out of prison and issues should p[ro]ceede against mee. Then I came away and after I did writt to him againe to ley open to him ye abuse of y court and to lett him know I had made my appearance, but at the end of the assize they caused Proclamationyt noe issues ahould p[ro]ceede against any wch appeared, soe as farr as it is knowne to mee, I and Frends are freed, and these other two Frends, my deare hearts, who stand valiant wth mee,…but noe tryall nor examination of wittnesses of my part concerneinge ye abomination of the preist would bee heard, but denyed, soe as they came, they left mee, in bonds wth seaven other…fellowe prisoners”; John Killam “is brought to prison for speakeinge to the preist [John Jackson] of Doncaster in his preachinge, as they call it and is wth mee, and there is five in prison at Owse [Ouse] Bridge in the cittie [of York]- Bosswell [Boswell] Midleton [Middleton], Hen[ry] Fooler [Fowler], Agnes Wilkinson, Annas [Ann] Nichelson [Nicholson] and another younge woeman [Barbara Pattison], imprisoned for speakeinge to the people in the street in Yorke. Another they oast into prison for throwinge bookes into their coatches [coaches], but hee is turned out againe”; none were set free “out of the cittie prison, but here was three sent forth here, but never called beefore them, but cryed in the court to see if any could wittnesse anything against them, but none appeared. My bro[ther] Will[iam] Dewsburrie [Dewsbury], Mary Fisher and John Snawden [Snowden] are gone forth of prison, and Mary Fisher and Mary Howgill are gone up towards London”, having had movings to go thither; “Deare Bro[ther] Geor[ge] Fox, my love and life is wth thee”; love to Margeret Fell; love from John Killam “to thee and to Margaret Fell”; “Let Margeret see these passages”; Friends at London are well; “I heard lat[e]ly from them, but they have great encounteringe there. Many are convinced of the Truth but fewe owne the Crosse”; love from fellow prisoners

Wee allsoe told him yt wee remember[e]d noe such words spoken by thee when wee were present (as'whor[e]s amd rogu[e]'s) and asked tho[mas] Beale if hee heard any such words from thee. He said 'noe', but he beleeved yt Hener[y] Sweeting spake truth in aserting that thee didest speak such words, soe Hen[ry] Sweeting saith that none of us was there when thou spake those things, but thee spak[e] them to him in his hall, there being by his wife [Ann] and daughters and Edward Parking [Parkin], ye tayler [see also number 199a] by ye meeting place, who came in and was there some part of ye time and wee have spake wth him about it, who saith yt as to 'whores and rogues' he cannot well remember  yt, though once he said yt he thought thee might say soe to, but of M[ast]er Story being named and of dof[f]ing ye hat, those things he witneseth, and of either sending or speaking wth ye woman of ye house wher[e] it was don[e], allsoe he witneseth.

Contents: "about a night after...wee had beene ye first time at Hener[y] Sweeting's about ye [a]foresaid [see number 202 above, and also number 199a] busines, they sent for R[ichard] Martin and my selfe there againe, where was N[icholas] Lucas, Tho[mas] Beale, E[dward] Parkin and others", at which time N.L. [Nicholas Lucas] "shewed us this following paper [no longer with the letter] of J[ohn] Story's" and added that "now he had an author, wheras when once at H[enry] Sweeting's...he told thee of this former passage about J[ohn] Story and those words, yt thou should say where was his author and he could remember none, yt then thou cal[l]ed him lyer and bid his mouth be stoped,...and then he was much downe, as H[enry] Sweeting saith, because he could not rem[em]b[er] his author. but now his author is manyfest[ed] wch is H[enry] S[weeting] as it seems. N.L. [Nicholas Lucas] seemes much rejoysed yt they will stand to it and farther saith yt this is not all, for thou told another lye at Huntington [Huntingdon], soe I inquired w[ha]t that was and whoe would witnes it. Tho[mas] Beale said he, and affirmed it to be soe, wch as he saith, was thy saiing to young Rob[ert] Raby, when he asked thee if thou had never seene those papers wch thou asked for of him, and that thou should say (noe), and T.B. saith yt I was cal[le]d for a witness then being in ye roome at R[ichard] Jobson's, and as he saith, yt wth much reluctan[ce] at last I should say yt indeed being pres[s]ed 3 times by Rob[ert] Raby at his father's (I did say thou hadest seene them). This T.B. affermes, to wch I say yt I could not say yt thou hadest seene them, for though I had seene them a litle about halfe a qu[art]er of an hower at W[illia]m Phillip['s] at Statfould [Stotfold, in Bedfordshire], and yt thou was in ye roome, yet I wound them up again, and as I rem[em]b[er] gave them to Sam[uel] Goodaker [Goodacre], and did not know if thee did see them, any other then as by acsident in my hand and...sin[ce?] not given to thee by L[ewis] Laundy, neither had I heard thee say th[ou had] seene them and further I doe still testify yt I rem[em]ber not yt I [heard thee?] say at R[ichard] Jobson's yt thou hadest not seene them, and becuase I m[entioned?] yt thou did say yt thou had not seene them, Th[omas] Beale judges...yt ye Lord will meete wth me for evading ye Truth, and much have [they?] made about this and spred it about ye country, reporting yt if I will j[ust con?]ferme this for a truth ag[ains]t thee (wch I cannot), for they say yt they can prove by severall witneses yt thee hadest heerd [heard] ye papers read at Stotfold and yt Rob[ert] Goods came in when C[hristopher] Tayler [Taylor] (as I rem[em]b[er]) was reading them unto thee. If T[homas] Dockrell [Dockray] was by at R[ichard] Jobson['s], it may be he might rem[em]b[er] something of ye passage allsoe"; they "make it their indeaav[our] to rende[r] thee reproachfull and to cast ly[e]s and slanders on thee"; (postscript from John Story- as for the report "the inclos[e]d carryes, I know nothing of it, noe more then a child unborne, and...I doe deny any such thing was done where I was present or yt I ever heard of any such thing done any where under the profession of ye Truth"; also as for what they call "the seperrat [separate] meeting in Westmoreland [Westmorland], to manage church affaiers, I never was at any of them to this day, neither was I of counsell wth them about any busines they transacted in those meetings to this day. I have acquainted them wth it [and] they allsoe deny they know any such thing, and doe deny the abominable practises of all whor[e]s and rogues in the world")

[George Fox's] own hand writing becaus[e] he (I think) can nether writ[e] nor spell soe well, butt it se[e]ms to be his spiritt, if nott his dictating, and if y[o]u cannott find whoe did itt then sum of y[o]u according to y[o]ur terms to others may be termed impudent, bould-fased lyars (say nott I call y[o]u soe)"; (Postscript- "Thes[e] be sum of y[o]ur terms to ye oposers, viz., 'Past shame', 'jouned wth the divell', (and this notorious lye), 'they nam[e] stinks wher'ever thy boocks [books] come', 'impudent face[d], impudent', 'sum would h[ave] thought [he] had bin an honest man',...'thou art as deceipt-full in thy trad[e] as thou art in thy religion', 'thou art not to be trusted noe way, butt to be abhorred of all men'. Thes[e] be y[o]ur terms to T.C. [Thomas Crisp] by som of y[o]ur nam[e]less party wch hav[e] cost much moony [money], besid[e]s ye terms in print, as 'cheat' etc., and yett y[o]u find fault wth the word 'Foxonians'. This Scriptur[e] is fullfilled one [on] thee G.W. [George Whitehead], and sum others... The unjust knows noe shame")
