Waerde vriend, hier door moogt gy weeten hoe dat den Heer door 
syn ?ige Kracht Jacob Geylbers geraeckt heeft, en door het 
waerachtige licht hem heeft laeten hien de Wendige standt daer hy
in was, an haeden heer dee weg in hem geopenbaart hadde, en 
toonde hem klaerin het licht wat hy laeten sonder teweeten syn 
mact toe teden en niet meer teprodickten? want hy volede het 
oordeel gotds op hem voorall dat hy oyt godaen hadde, en hy was 
heer gebroocken on hy hadde tot aerent gerrits (oock von 
prodicker) geseyt dat hy venen halinen dag voor den heere 
gesiddert en gebeeht hadde en dat hy de heerlyckheyt godts gesien
hadde, ende in die tyt was hy seer teder, en dit was 14 daagen 
vor u brieff aen dirck Janss quam.
Ende doen ginck hy indie teederre stant by syn broeder tyinen 
gysbers on dirck allers (beyde predikers ende de aene aen outste)
en opense? syn stant voor haer maer sy waeren wendige trossters 
tot hem want sy seyden dat het de ingeringe des duiwels was an 
leyden voor hem hoe haere voorraeders geleeft hadden en hoe 
bedrelmden de teederre plante godts in hem, ande drangen den 
dienst dieu dag op hem, an hy antwoorde, in dien dit inbeelding 
en ingeringe des satans is, soo weet ick geen weg om salig 
toworden en soo hy was ouerrompelt, en hy ginck in 
ongehoorsaamheyt voort tegenden heere en predickte dien dag; maer
soo haert als hy gedaen hadde reek het getuygenisse godts 
leuendig in hem op als aen vlam, en hy was gevoelig dat het 
oordeel gotds op hem was om syn ongehoorsaemheyts wille,, ende 
doen voelde hy dat syn harte toegeflooten was, dat hy den heer 
niet aenvoepen hande, en doe gincke hy klaegen en kermen, on als 
hy emtrent 14 daegen soo gegaen hadde quam hy by aerent gerrits 
als voer verhaelt en hy seyde hem hoe dat hy voor den heer 
gesiddert en geleeht hadde en hoe dat de aerde en alle aertsche 
dinge voor syn oogen vergingen, en hy sagde sterren van den 
heemel vallen, ende den heemel vloeg weg, en doen was de 
heerlyckheit godts in hem geoopenbaert, en daen sag hy den 
aelendigen stant van het geheele menschelycke geslacht etc.  Ande
daen beklaegde hy hem als voor vorhaelt en seyde tegens aerent 
Gerrits he dat die dienst op hem gedrangen was, en hie dat de de 
verbot, ontheyt godes op hem uyt gestort was, so dat hy niet 
ruhten kronde dag mochte nacht, ende aerent getuygde dat sy 
hadden soo niet met hem behooren tehandelen tegens seyn aygen 
gemoet.
Ande soo dien selfden aeuent quam hy by ons en hy vraegde offer 
noch wel genaede was voor jemant de welcke in aen goede stant 
geweest hadde onde ouertreden hadde, maer hy opende syn stant tot
ons inet dat hy het was maer affenwel wy waeren gevoelig dat hy 
geraeckt was, en seyden hem datter genaede genog was voor solck 
aen, maer toonden hem dat het oorde gedraegen moste wehen 
ingewilligheyt tot dat dat geene veroordeelt was het welcke 
tegens den heere gehoendigt hadde; en so wy toonden hem dat den 
heer naeby was tot die geene de welcke vorslaegen waeren am by 
was tot die geene de welcke verslaegen waeren am dosoodaenige 
tesalven, en seyden hem dat het den heere was die gewont hadde en
dat hy oock geweesen wilde etc.
An so, in deesen alendigen stant heeft hy omtrent aen maent lanck
geweest, en hy werde sieck en kreegde bellroose ende daer quamen 
vorscheiden alendige trasters by hem;
Ande doe quaemen de kostelycke dingen weeder in syn gehengenis 
dewelcke hy tevooren gesien hadde, en hy goetse voor haer uyt so 
lange tot dat hy leedig was, en sy seyden dat het maer 
inbeeldingen waeren, maer hy seyde of syhet geloofden of niet het
soude nochtans in der aewigkeyt waerheyt blyuen, en syde, in dien
sy saelig woehenwouden soe mosten sy de quaekers we in gaen en sy
souden de bancken maer op mackander teggen ende de deur van haer 
vorgaders plaets toespyckeren en haer predick briefjes verbranden
want sy waeren voort vier verordieneert, en souden in der stilte 
needer sitten om op den heer tewachten etc.
Ande de vriendt verhaelt verder van hem hoe dat hy sommes by hem 
quam en hoe hy op aen aeuent by hem was en hoe dien geheelen 
nacht syn hart soo vol was van loff tot den heere tot 
verwonderinge van haer alle, en hoe dat wanneer hy des aeuens 
aeten soude hy seyde, um will ick inde tegenwoordigheyt van u 
alle den weg der quaekers getuygen, en hy guckneedersitten aen de
taeffel gelyck vrienden gewoont syn, entahte met de leefel naet 
geene dat voor hem stant, maer t'scheen by art niet meer als aen 
leepel voll, hoewel hy op dien tyt in twee daegen niet geggeeten 
hadde etc.
An ook hoe dat hy sommes noch vrygevaelig was van het oordeel 
godts tegens hem om syn ongetrouwigheyt, on hadde onderanderen 
geseyt, myn broeders weyff heyt dat het de quaekers gederen 
hebben, maer geionwyse vrauw, het is de hant des heeren ouer my 
om myn on gehoorsaemheyts wille.
ande de vriendt schryft oock hoe dat veele van haer beyde 
predikers en anderre als bekennen mosten dat het de handt 
[several pages cut out]..[same hand but not clear if this is the 
same letter]
meist oock teraeken met syn kracht, ende tot haer in syn licht 
tewerschynen, (solcke woorden meene ick gebruyckt hy) waer door 
sy haer soo toe gedaen was dat sy alles konden krygen wat sy 
begerden, ande de vader hadde voorgenoomen an gefangen tesetten 
waer toe sy well scheenen gemaet tesyn om des waerheyts wille 
gevankenisse telyden sy hadden aen boeckje van vranckvort 
gekregen de saecke Christi ende synes volcks, waer meede sy hseer
vormaeckt waeren; de brooder die schryft ende verhaelt hoe 
wonderlyck dat het gegaen was met hem, die de gaewe van well 
spreekentheyt soo seer heeft, hy hadde by nae geheel stam geweeht
en niets tegens de priesters kunnen spreken, ande de Jungste 
brooder synde omtrent 17 Jaeren anders seer swaer tot spreken 
tebrengen, was soo voll geweest gelyck vorhaelt, dat de prysters 
hadden maeten stam worden, t'welck heer anmerklyck is, sy hadden 
de belofte Christus in haer seer voervult bevonden daer hy seyt: 
vreest niet wat ghy spreeken sult want het tot die selve ure u in
den mont soll gegeven worden.
Noch is het hier gebeurt dat Johannes op de Beurs sunde aen van 
syn Kennis by hem quam die tot erfort woont ende korts by syn 
moeder geweest hadde, Ende als hy Eerst by Johannes quam was hy 
hseer verstoort en bitter, vrooch hem wat voor een schelm hy un 
geworden was, Ende veele quaede woorden, welck johannes alles 
vordroegen weinig seyde, maer versocht mot hem nae syn losemont 
tegaen, gelyck hy deede, Ende alleen synde begon Johannes aen 
weinig van de Waerheyt tot hem te verklaeren, waer door hy tot 
stilheyt quam ende vorasacht johannes soude naederhant weeder by 
hem koomen gelyck hy deeden on brooder vor klaering van de 
waerhyt doende wiert de man soo geraeckt van de kracht godts dat

Lengthy pastoral beginnning praising the wonderous works of the Lord; "I shall now declare unto thee ye p[ar]ticulers of my p[ro]ceedings in Holland after I landed at Rotterdam. I remained thear som[e] few dayes finding littell to doe, only a rumour theare was about ye citty yt I was com[e] and som[e] reported yt I was a Jesuite and many threatning speeches was given out agt [against] me...but I finding my worke not to be theare at yt time, departed from thence to Middelburgh [Middelburg] in Zeeland [Zealand]...wch was about 60 English miles, but I haveing ben theare at at Flishing [Flushing] about two dayes, I was prest in my spirit to pass to Amsterdam (wch was about 102 English miles) wheare I remained som[e] few dayes and then I found som[e] drawings to pass to ye meeting place of ye English upon ye first day wthin ye citty and when I came theare I sate down amongst som[e] yt seemed to be zealous in theire way wch were speaking one to another of Christ and of faith, but after a short time, I was moved to speake amongst them whearat they seemed to be astonished and owned my words and desired me to stay and heare theire minister, but I having severall bookes about me wch suffitiently declared w[ha]t theire minister was and all his generation, I left them amongst them and departed, and hearing of a meeting of English Brownists thither I went and after the man yt was speaking had don[e], I began to speak, but he who had spoken came himselfe from ye highest place in ye assembly with another and thrust me out and shutt ye door to keep me out (at which som[e] of his owne members were offended), and after this I continued certaine days in yt citty, much wearyed in my spirit and nevertheless had no freedom to pass from thence but one day passing along ye street, a seaman mett me, whom before to my knowledge I never saw and he tolde me yt in ye citty theare was a woman wch was a friend of mine and moreover he tolde me he would enquire wheare shee lodged...wch ye next day by his meanes I found, but shee was gon in her journey towards England, but ye sayde seaman tolde me of another who was so accounted wch came from London about som[e] outward occasions, but he was gon[e] som[e] parte of ye way wth her, but he suddenly returned and when he came he tolde me of a people yt were very neer ye Truth, so we past together unto them and desired a meeting wch was granted wheare I had liberty to declare and severall received my testimony [the meeting may have been that of the Flemish Mennonites and among those who received the Truth at that time may have been Jacob Williamson Sewell and Judith Zinspenning, the parents of William Sewell; see William Hull, The Rise of Quakerism in Amsterdam, 1655-1665, pp. 94-94], so in a short space it was noised about ye citty and severall meetings I had and many opposers came, but they were taken in theire owne snares and confounded. From thence, I past to Harelem [Haarlem], a citty about 9 English miles from thence whear I had two meetings and not without severall contenders, but they were taken as ye former and the Truth was made manifest. From thence I past to Rotterdam (wch is about 30 English miles) wheare I had a large meeting and few opposers. From thence I past to a towne called Vlaeden [Vlaardingen?] (wch is 6 English miles) wheare I had a meeting and severall owned the Truth and then I returned to Rotterdam and had another meeting wheare the contenders were so made manifest that a seperation began to be betwixt those that owned the Truth and the contenders, and a silent meeting was determined. From thence I returned to Amsterdam (wch is about 42 English miles) wheare severall meetings I had and many were convinced and likewise severall of Middelburgh [Middelburg] wch is about 3 miles distant and then I had thoughts of passing for England, a shipp being neere ready, wch was bound for Newcastell [Newcastle], but in the meane time I received thy letter with wch my soule was refreshed, which signifyed to me that John Stubbs was coming to me. Then was I moved to returne to Amsterdam (wch is about 105 English miles) and the[a]r being com[e], I found John Stubbs (wch meeting by me will never be forgotten) and severall meetings we had in that citty and wonderfully was the power of God made manifest and the opposers of the Truth confounded. From thence we past to Haerlem [Haarlem] whear a pure seed we found and having declared oure message, we returned the same day to Amsterdam. Afterwards we past to a place called Sardam [Zaandam] wheare we were received with much love and not long after we past to a citty called Alckwaer [Alkmaar] whear severall received us, and a pure seed theare we found. From thence to Haerlem we past...and from thence we past to Rotterdam wheare severall meetings we had...and from thence we past to Utrucht [Utrecht] wheare with great love we were received...From thence we past into Zeeland [Zealand] and at Flishing we had a meeting consisting of severall sorts of people but all chayned by the Eternal power that although the meeting was very large yet not one word objected, and from thence in the eternall freedom we past to the shipp accompanied with severall Freinds (great in the outward), som[e] lamenting oure departure, others hoping for the coming of som[e] other out of England to direct theire mindes that they might be established in the Truth...We have ben with George [Fox] and weare to pass into Ireland and from thence through Scotland and into Flanders and through Holland and into Jermany [Germany] and much I see of passing into Denmark”

Abstract: Copy 
of letter to Margaret Fell.  Utrecht, 17. ii. 1657
"I cannot express the love which is towards thee.....My dear 
love to thy family who are dear in the Lord, and to E.S. and the 
rest."

Original is in Swarth. Mss. iv. 28. Trans. i. 71
Notes: William Ames 
to Margaret Fell
From Utrecht the 17 of the 2nd month 1657

I cannot express the love which is towards thee and the rest of 
my dear brethren and sisters.  Often do I receive refreshment 
through the remembrance of htee.  These are to give thee an 
account of the passages here, and how things are.  My journey 
into Holland was long, for I was on board the ship three weeks, 
being sometimes put into harbours by contrary winds.  In the day 
time I sometimes went on shore, and being driven twice in Harwich

in Suffolk, the last time, it was so ordered, that I got a 
meeting in the town and several of the Baptists came and heard:  
the power of the Lord was with me, and there was no resistance in
word, but a meeting was desired the next day in the country, 
which was [held] accordingly.  There was such a love raised in 
that town that some of them came rowing in a boat a great way 
when the ship was under sail, purposely to see me.  Having a good
wind we came to Holland.  After I had been there about ten days, 
and had had several meetings the Friend in whose house I lodged 
was sent for before the magistrates, and by then was he required 
to bring me before them, and another young man who was in Holland
with Will. Caton, who likewise came over with me.  When we came 
before them they had nothing to alledge against us, only we would
not put off our hats; but they caused them to be taken off.  The 
Lord made me as a brasen wall against them:  they were a light 
company of men, but in the power of the Lord their folly, in 
wisdom and moderation was witnessed against; through which they 
were confounded.  When they asked me any question, I answered 
them as I was free in the Lord; and they said one to another, the
things which I did speak was but reason; and having nothing to 
lay to our charge, they bid us depart, and appear before them on 
the morrow.  Their was a book in Luting(?) which was to 
magistrates given forth by G.F. which I left with them.  On the 
morrow we appeared before them again, and great was the dominion 
in the Lord, over their heads.  After all their questions; they 
being asked, could lay nothing to our charge, but they concluded 
to banish us out of the city, and commanded us to depart out of 
it, and a league from it within twenty four hours.  I asked them 
again the cause.  They said it was their will, and they would 
give us no other account; Upon which I answered (after 
discovering their evil [unto them] and so clearing myself of 
them), that I thought I should not depart until I had freedom in 
the Lord, except I was thereunto forced.  So they seeing our 
resolution sent us to prison and commanded we should not be 
together, neither should any come to us, and each of us was shut 
up in a dark [indistinct] where we remained four days; at the end
of which time we were sent for, first my friend, and then I.  But
when I came before them, they told me they had sent for me to 
know if I had changed my resolution, and to be released out of 
prison, to obey their command and depart the town; but the 
dominion which the Lord gave me in his power and wisdom is not to
be expressed, so I said it was not their prison, neither death 
should separate me from the love of God, for therein said I, is 
my rejoicing; it is my father's house and it is all one to me 
whether I am in or out, for I know your power is limited

So they proceeded with arguments to persecute me to go, but their
Language was confounded.  then they asked me if they caused the 
doors to be not open whether I would go out [of amsterdam]; but I
answered, out of the city I should not go, until it was the will 
of the Lord, except I was forced out; then said they we can force
you out, but will you stay in.  I told them, in that I could not 
satisfy them.  With many other words in the fear and power of the
Lord, I declared their conditions unto them, but they sent us 
again to prison, where we remained two days more, and then they 
sent for us and told us, it was decreed that in the evening 

between the eighth and ninth hour we should be conducted out of 
the town, and threatened us with sore punishment if we came in 
again:  so I passed to Rotterdam where I had two pretty meetings,
and Friends were reached, and those who had run out and lost 
themselves in measure, are brought to see their loss and the 
cause of it, it being shewed them; and they are pretty low and 
tender, and are very hopeful, for there is a true love in them 
raised.

After I had remained some days near Rotterdam, I passed to 
Utrecht, where now I am, and have pretty service, the power of 
the Lord being my strength, without which I can do nothing.  [At]
the last meeting that I had, after I had spoken one of them began
to ask questions, seeking to ensnare; but out of their own mouths
were they judged, and they fell into the pit which they [had] 
made for me; for in answering their questions, they were proved 
to be ignorant of the sure foundation, and their confusion being 
in few words laid open to their own view, their mouths were 
stopped, and they remained silent; so in the power and fear of 
the Lord I exhorted htem to repentance; to mind the Light, and so
left them, at which our Friends, to see their grand opposers 
confounded, were much established.

Dear heart, my service seems to be much in these parts, but as 
the work is great, so I find the strength of the Lord to answer 
it, blessed be His name.  Pray that I may be preserved in his 
fear, power, and wisdom to finish my testimony in faithfulness; 
Faithfulness to the Lord is that which my soul desireth, that so 
he alone may receive the honour and the glory.  My dear love to 
thy family who are dear in the Lord; and to E. S and the rest

Will Ames

Humble Thatcher the Friend that is with me hath his love 
rememberd to thee, and desireth thy prayers.

Dear Margaret
Thou knowest I love thee, and great cause I have to love thee 
above all others that even I yet saw, because such an overlowing 
of wisdom and love (in which my soul hath been refreshed and my 
life strengthened) is in thee, I never yet in such a measure 
could be sensible of in any other for in weakness thou hast 
strengthened me, and has borne my infirmities in patience and 
wisdom, and when other Friends (of great account) have been no 
small tryall to me, even then have I felt thy love supporting, 
therefore my soul loves thee, for wherever I am and under what 
triall soever? the virtue of thy love I can feel which is 
refreshment and strength unto me.

Dear heart I have been in this country about eight or nine weeks,
and truly if it were not that the might powerful presence of the 
Lord was with me (which not only Friends, but likewise enemies 
are made to feel and confess) Friends might think I was not owned
of Friends in England, because not one letter have I received 
since I came over exept one from William Caton, although there is
something of concernment which some at London ought not to be 
silent in for the truth's sake, and unto whom to impart these 
things I know not, except it be to thee or William Caton.

Since I came over here several are convinced, and meetings are 
precious, and the work goes on, but much resistance I have had by
wise philosophers and professors, but it hath tended much to the 
confirmation of the simple; and truly dear heart the dreadful 
presence of the Lord is such that it even breaks the heathen; 
when they come into our meeting they are astonished.  Glory be 
unto his name forevermore!  Remember my dear love to all Friends 
about thee as thou art free.  I do greatly desire to hear from 
thee.  My dear brother in the everlasting truth
(Will Ames)

Here hath been several pretty Friends with me from severall 
parts, who are much comforted with the power of the Lord.  
Friends in Germany salute you all

Chriesheim in Palatine 14 of 12 mo 1660

Dear G. F.
This is to let thee know how it is here, and to give thee an 
account of passages.  I have not been here near four weeks, and I
found Friends well, fresh and lively.  After I had been here some
days I went to visit a widow woman, who in our speech is commonly
called a Countess, who had desired to speak with me [and] who 
behaved herself very discretely and lovingly, and confessed to 
the Truth, but there were raging priests which sought by all 
means to withstand the truth but she remained sober and loving, 
and did thank me that I had come so far for her sake, but the 
effect I shall leave to the Lord.

The last week I was also with the Prince:  when he heard of my 
being in the city where he resides, he sent for me after it was 
night; so I went, and had with me several volumes of Latin and 
English books, which I had caused to be bound up for him in 
Holland; which he received very willingly and promised to read 
them. I was with him till it was late in the night; then when I 
desired to be gone, he gave order for one to go with me to 
lodging, it being without the city, and caused the gates to be 
opened Afterwards he sent me word by theh captain of his life 
guards (I desiring to know whether he had any thing else to say 
to me) that if I stayed in teh city he would be glad to see me 
again, but to stay only for his sake I need not.  I had good 
service there amonst them; I find that the man loves me.

Here is a report that Friends did rise against the King, which 
teh Prince also spoke of; but I told him it was not according but
contrary both to our faith and principles to act any such thing, 
whereupon he did forbear to accuse us with it.

My intent is not to stay long here, but shortly to pass towards 
Prague in Bohemia.  The power of the Lord God is over this 
country; the sound of truth hath gone over it, and both priests 
and people know they are wicked, but there is not such a heart in
them to seek the Lord.  The Lord God Almighty carry on his own 
work to the glory and praise of his name!

My desire is that thy prayer to God may be, that I may be kept, 
to the praise of his name.

Thy dear and tender brother,
will Ames

[William Caton], I shall...proceed to give thee a brief account”; after passing from Amsterdam, he headed towards the Paltz [Pfalz], but on the way, he stopped in Holland and Coln [Koln i.e. Cologne] where he had some service “for the sound of Truth hath ben much among [them], to wit, in Gelderland and Cleveland, where many Baptists dwells” but although he went among them and several have been convinced, “yet little is brought forth”; from there he passed towards the Pfaltz [Pfalz] “having littel service by the way”, and after spending some time with Friends, passed to Heidelburgh [Heidelburg] “to visit the Prince...and to give him severall volum[e]s, as well Latin as English and Dutch, which I judged might be best for him, which in Holland I had caused to be bound up for him. And coming into the citty, the Captaine of of {{unsure if this is a transcription error or if the repetition is in the letter--CW}} his lifeguard saw me in the street [and] though there were others in his company, not of the meanest, yet he readily came...[to] manifest his great affection towards me, takeing me by  the hand in the street and desire[ing me to pass] to his house, which accordingly I did”; that same evening, the Prince, hearing of his arrival, “sent a servant with a torch to light me up to his palace, and when I came there he told mee I was wellcom[e] and began to aske me what I thought of that report conserning Friends riseing against the King [Charles II]. I tolde him I knew it was a false report and many moderate words past bet[ween] us to that purpose, he shewing me the Diurnall printed in English, for it was just about that time, but I could not see that he was very ready to beleeve any such thing of us, and after the Captaine of his guard saide that he had written (to witt, the Capt[ain]) to a good friend for the certainty of the matter and had received answere that we were innocent in it. Soe after supper (after I had given him the bookes which he gladly received), he caused [me] to follow him into another roome, where in the presence of them all...I had freedom to declare that which was in my heart to him, shewing him the Truth on the one side, and on the other side, the wickednes of the priests, the falsnes of [their] doctrine, the unjustnes of tithes and the sufferings of my Friends in that country, which he heard without seeming to be offended at all, but asked me whether I did not know that [pr]iests were needfull as to the upholding of theire politique goverment. Then I shewed him that  they were the men who were destructive to good goverment and I alsoe manifested the [lo]ve of Friends towards him...which seemed to please him”; he [Ames] now desired to head for his lodging which was outside the city but feared that the gates would be shut, whereupon he [the Prince] appointed someone “to accompany me with a torch to my lodgeing and to cause the gates to be opened for me”; the next day, “I desireing to know whether he had any thing more to say to me, he sent me word that if I did com[e] to visit him, I should be wellcom[e], but as for that which he had to say to me, I need not stay”; while in that country, he [Ames] also had good service with a countis [countess] “soe called in English” who proved to be moderate and did love them [Friends] for their goodness but was “not soe convinced as in all things to join with us, but doth hang to the priest, not for theire goodness but because of theire cerimonyes. Truth in that country hath a great dominion though few com[e] into the obedience of it as yet”; from there he passed towards Bohemia, searching the country as he went but found “an enmity raysed in most peopel [ag]ainst the very name of Quakers, for that wicked report [of the Quaker rebellion against Charles II; see above] was spread over all the countryes in print”; did have ample opportunity to declare the Truth but while several confess it to be the Truth, “yet it had so littel entrance upon them and affected soe littel with them that I shall omitt to enlarge upon that”; notes that the inhabitants of each of those countries follows the religion of their rulers; thus Lutheran rulers have Lutheran subjects, with the exceptions being papists and Jews amongst whom he had little service; instead he passed towards Brandenburgh [Brandenburg] and then into Pomerania in order to take shipping for Dantzick [Danzig], and on coming into the latter, he found, in a short time, he was “much knowne, and had very great service in that place”; the first meeting he had there “was in the field and [was] pretty large and sti[ll] and severall thear are convinced; afterwards we had another meeting in a wood, but after that we got a house to meet in”; after that “we past (for it is to be understood that in all this journy I had a Friend [Jan Hendricks; see William Hull, The Rise of Quakerism in Amsterdam 1655-1665, pp. 67-79] of the Pfaltz [Pfalz] with me, for they were not at all free that I should goe alone) towards Poland about 6 or 7 schore [shore] myles up into the country and had service at severall [pla]ces amongst Baptists, but they are a very wicked people notwithstanding theire profession, and the inhabitants of Poland are much like unto the Ireish [Irish] people, being enclined...but alsoe living in all wickednes and especially drunckennes, adultery and murder [and] soe hear are many of them called gentlemen who through the warrs have lost theire estates and...have a law that if a gentlemen killeth his subject, there can be noe more demanded of him but 2 rich daelders [rix-dollars] which is less then 10s, and they who are tolerated by a law to k[ill] subjects doe rather chuse to kill strangers to get what they have if they can light upon them”; after speaking the Truth to those who could understand him, he returned back towards Dantzick [Danzig] which city was in an uproar over them [Ames and Hendricks] as the magistrates had sought for him after he had gone to Poland and intercepted some letters sent to him from Holland “with a pretty great parcell of bookes in Dutch” and warnings were issued as to what the magistrates would do to him should they get him; yet, “I took the intercepting of the bookes and letters as [an] occasion given for me to goe to them [the magistrates]...which accordingly I did, but was not permitted to apeare before them all, but [was] sent to one of the Burgemeester’s [Burgomaster’s] houses to stay there till he came”; when he came “with another”, he was “something rough” at first, but by the time they were ready to part, “they seemed very friendly, asking simpely the truth of many thing[s] where with we were slaundered, soe after long discours, they restored my letters to me and did seem to be confounded that they had broke them open, but my bookes they saide I should not have, fearing I would spread them, but I desired they would let me have one which they bid me take, but after a little longer discourse, he bid me take soe many as I would. Then I tolde him I should distribute them if they gave me more then that one (for that was one newly printed which [I] desired to see and tolde them I thought not to part with it there). He saide I might take them not withstanding, which I did, and instead of being churlish and stubborn, they rose up from theire seats to conduct me out of the house”; after coming from them, “great was the dominion of Truth and such who before feared to speak with me were glad of the opertunity, and they who were convinced were strengthened...and bookes much inquired for”; he then took shipping for Holland; “I was alsoe with one of the chiefe priests of that citty [Danzig] and had much conferrence [with] him”

Dear George
I passed through Brandenburgh and so into Pomerania to take 
shipping for Dantzic; and when I came thither, in a short time I 
was much known, and had very great service in that place.  The 
first meeting I had there was in the fields, and pretty large and
still, and several there are convinced;  Afterwards we had 
another meeting in a wood, but after that we got a house to meet 
in.  After this we passed (for it is to be understood that in all
this journey I had a Friend of the Palatinate with me, for they 
were not at all free that I should go alone) towards POland, 
about six or seven score miles up into the country, and had 
service at several places, amongst Baptists, but they are a very 
wicked people, notwithstanding their profession; and the 
inhabitants of Poland are much like unto the Irish people, being 
inclined, and not only so, but also living in all wickedness, and
especially drunkenness, adultery and murder; for there are many 
of them called gentlemen, who through the wars have lost their 
estates, and they have a law that if a gentleman killeth his 
subject, there can be no more demanded of him but two rix dollars
which is less than ten shillings.  After I had sounded forth the 
truth amonst such who could understand, to wit the [torn] I 
returned again towards Dantzic, being clear of that country (as I
am at present) but when I [torn] thither the city was as it were 
filled with the noise of us -- but great was the dominion of 
truth, and such who before feared to speak with me were glad of 
the opportunity; and they who were convinced were strengthened 
(as [torn] mayst judg).  So being clear in the sight of God, and 
seeing it not convenient for me to stay longer in that place, at 
that time, I took shipping for Holland.  I was also with one of 
the chief priests of that city, and had much conference with him.

Dear George
I have been in this place about 16 days, and have been refreshed 
in the service which I have had, though few receive my testimony 
yet some are convinced, and a love is raised in them towards me; 
the last first day I was at a meeting of Baptists, which I 
believe consisted of several hundreds, where I had good service, 
in a few words which I spoke amonst them, and withal put forthh a
seasonable query to the teacher of them and desired an answer, 
but he would not be persuaded to answer, though they confessed 
that my behaviour was no otherwise than like a Christian; 
notwithstanding with hard speeches to their hearers they 
endeavoured to drive them out that they might not hear what was 
spoken, but afterward several of them came to me, which all 
condemned their preachers carriage towards me that day; and here 
are several enquiring, but as yet we cannot get a place to 
appoint a meeting in, for some who are somewhat convinced are 
possessed with fear, and they who would, have not the conenience;
yet I hope the Lord will make way for it; here is also another 
sort of Baptists, who have given out speeches.

Dear Sister, 
Thine this day I have recieved, dated in London the 6th of the 
1st month, which is no small refreshing to me in a strange land, 
where wickedness abounds.  My dear sister, my heart is full, and 
the endless fountain of your Father's love floweth forth to thee,
for thou hast travailed for me, and hast been a nursing mother to
me.  Since I came out of the Palatinate; (where I was some time 
with our dear Friends there, and was with the PRince, who shewed 
more friendship than ever, but because I do think that my dear 
brother, W. Caton hath given thee an account of passages, I omit 
the particulars) I have travelled through many dominions, and 
through Bohemia, but the power of darkness hath the possession of
it; the people are generally slaves within and without.  When I 
have told htem of the wickedness of their priests they confess 
it, and confess the wickedness of their rulers, and their own 
wickedness, and confess to the truth, but say they, we must do as
our Lords will have us, or else we may not live here, for we are 
theirs; we must both do and believe as they will have us; and 
with this spirit is the multitude guided, that my sould is even 
grieved to see it.  In this city I have been above two weeks; a 
town like Sodom, the wickedness is hard to be mentioned; Truth is
acknowledged by some, but they are not worthy of it.  This city 
borders upon Poland, which is the place intended, when I came 
from the Palatinate, yet not this side of the Country, therefore 
tomorrow I intend to take my journey by water towards Dantzic, 
and that side of Poland which at present lies upon me.  
Travelling is difficult, yet the Lord hath preserved me hitherto.
I have an honest man with me, a Friend of Palatinate, who could 
not be clear to let me pass alone.  My soul is filled with 
praises to the Lord, because he saveth his people, though he 
suffereth the enemy to afflict, yet he giveth power in teh inward
man, to them who trust in Him.  Let thy prayer be to God that I 
may be preserved unspotted, for many snares hath satan laid, to 
ensnare my soul, but hitherto hath the Lord delivered me out of 
them all, for he knows my whole heart is in him, and this 
presence is my whole delight.  My clear love to thy daughter M. 
and H. F. and the rest of Friends with thee:  thy dear brother in
the measure of life which never ends
Wll. Ames

PS by William Caton
Dear M. since the sealing up of my letter for England, I have 
even now received this acceptable letter for thee.  I took 
special care of thine to get it to him though he was far remote 
in a strange land.  And likewise it was upon me to be diligent in
letting him know (according to his earnest desire), how it was 
with Friends in England.  I have little to acquaint thee with at 
present, besides what I have writ to E. B. [E. Burrough] which I 
desire that thou may have a sight of.  Dear W. A. desires me to 
give G. [Geo Fox] an account of those things which he hath here 
writ to thee; but of that I shall discharge myself by referring 
it to thee, hoping that you will not be far distant at the 
receipt hereof.  It is my desire very much to hear of Friends in 
teh north, but especially of the dear children, who are so often 
in my thoughts; yet from none of them do I hear neither do I know
very well by whom I shall hear of them, excepting it be thyself, 
thought I have not for some weeks writ particularly to thee, yet 
it was my desire that you mgith see that which I wrote to others.
My dearest love is with thee.

snares, which ye friends saw, & were delivered from, The sd 
priest flattering & inviting htem into a house with others sought

wounded, & called friends cunning & subtill for not entering into
their snares, who came away in peace

Wrote to him formerly “but as yett have received no answer, wch makes mee doubt ye miscarriage of mine”; for the present, “wee have not im[m]ediate opportunitie to send to England by reason there is no setled trade thither, wch notwithstanding may conveniently bee effected in its proper season, here being com[m]odities as tobaccos, oyle, hides and tallow to transport thither, and Holland’s busses [vessels used to fish herring] may come in safely of about 150 tunn, drawing about 9 foot [of] water. The cuntry produces plentifully with as little labour as any I have knowe, all things necessary for ye life of man. It wants only industrious people fearing God. Wee at present have peace wth all ye nations of ye indians, and the great fatt King of ye Tuskiroroes [Tusoaroras] was not long since with me haveing had an indian slaine in these partes” and having been informed “it was by the English”; however, on inquiry, “I found out ye murtherer...was a Chewan [Chowan] indian, one of their great men’s sons, whom I im[m]ediately order[e]d to bee apprehended, but ye Chewan indians bought his life of ye Tuskiroroes King for a great quantity of Wamp[um] and peage. This Tuskiroroe King was very desirous to cutt of[f] a nation of indians called ye Matchepungoes [Machapungas] wch I have at present prevented and hope I shall leave ye cuntry att peace wth all ye indians and one with another”; however the people “are very fearful of falling in to some troubles againe if I should leave ym before my bro[ther] [Seth] Sothell [Sothel, governour of the Carolinas] returnes, wch makes my stay ye longer. This Tuskiroroe King seems to bee a very wise man as to naturall parts. Some of ye indians neare mee are so civilized as to come into English habits and have cattle of their owne, and I looke upon their outward civilizing as a good preparation for ye Gospell”; only wish that “all yt had knowne itt had been faithfull”, for God “forsakes none butt the unfaithfull”; “What I writt unto yee in my former I can[n]ot butt againe repeat wch is a desire to bee had in remembrance by yee, haveing a faith in ye power yt was by yee in this last age of ye world first preached and convinced mee in ye begining and separated mee from my father’s house”; wishes that “these partes had binn more visited by Friends...[but] ye im[m]ediate sence and growth of ye divine Seed is encouragement to all yt witness the same”; 
(Postscript—sends love to Friends and to Geo[rge] Keith “whose books of ye way to ye citty of God [The Way to the city of God described (1678); Wing K235] hath binn very serviceable unto mee”; love to Geo[rge] Whitehead and William Meade)

From the Common gaol in Kingston upon Thames
this 25of 6 month 1657

GF and FH

Dear Brethren I am with you in the Spirit, and my dear love, in 
that which is endless, everlasting and eternal doth salute you 

all -- dear is my love unto you at this time, abounding largely 
towards you; and it melts my heart at the remembrance of what the
Lord hath done for us, and by us, whose power is mighty in us and
with us, to the overthrowing of the kingdom of the man of sin.  
This is to let you know the present state that I am in, for I 
know you are not ignorant of the great labour and travail that I 
have gone through; and of the many burdens that I have borne for 
the Truth's sake; and to this day I have been kept by the power 
oft he Lord, to bear witness to his name; and the Lord hath made 
my testimony effectual, and blessed it with his presence, and my 
enemies have not had power over me, till it was given them from 
above.

I am now in outward bonds for the Truth's sake (though perfectly 
free in the Lord) in the common gaol in Kingston upon Thames, and
this in short is themanner of it.  THe last first day being the 
23rd of htis instant was a General Meeting at this town appointed
by Friends some weeks before, and the Sixth day I came from 
London, with a purpose in the Lord to stay the First day meeting,
and being in the meeting while speaking the word of the Lord, 
there being very many people, the two bailiffs and all teh 
officers of the Town came into the orchard, and I was taken away 
to one of hte Bayliffs houses and kept about an hour and 
examined, but nothing found against me, only many vain questions 
and suppositions what evil the  meeting might produce etc., only 
I was very soberly desired to break [up] the meeting, and 
disperse the people, lest evil should fall out, and such like:  
So I being dismissed passed again into the meeting and the mighty
powerful presence of the Lord was among us, and the meeting very 
large; and about the second hour came again another officer and 
told me that the magistrates gave way for me to come into their 
meeting (the steeple house) and object what I could, and about 
the third hour I passed out of our meeting (leaving all our 
Friends quiet in their own meeting) into their steeple house none
at all [went] with me except one, and I heard the man preach not 
the fourth part of an hour, till he had ended, and liberty [was] 
given by him for any to object that could:  so all was quiet, and
I haveing gathered several heads of his words in that time into 
my mind, I soberly pitched upon on particular [doctrine], which 
shamed him in the sight of all honest people, so that in the 
fourth part of an hour, he desired the magistrates to dismiss the
people, but they being quiet he ran away out of his pulpit, and I
staid till the magistrates rising up, the priest being gone, and 
bade me to depart, so in a very little time I did, with much 
advantage and renown to the Truth.  In the evening the rage of 
the priest and rulers being great, because Truth fell heavy upon 
them, they sent for me and presented me the oath of abjuration, 
which denying they commanded me to come in the morning again to 
them, which I did, and still the oath was presented to me, for 
they said, they did know and find me to be a man of parts, and 
therefore did groundedly suspect me to be a Jesuit.  they 
adjourned till the afternoon, and four of the magistrates and the
priest speedily took coach to Hampton Court, a mile from this 
town, to the Protector where he was, and there consulted and 
returned.  Again they stronly proferred me the oath, but I denied
-- I was Yesternight brought into this place, and I plainly see 

it must be thus, and it is to me of the Lord, and his end and 
glory shall be accomplished in it, and it shall not be in vain --
I have no cause of trouble in it, but much rather of joy and 
peace, knowing that it shall be for the furherance of the gospel 
-- Again more than all this about thirty horses were seized upon 
on first day, and they and the men kept two days in the town, and
this morning nine of the men committed; they are of Surrey; so 
that we are ten, in a little, bad, stark room, which would to me 
be the greatest trouble if I were not wholly kept above it -- I 
left all Friends well in the city, five days since; Gerard 
Roberts with some others of them were with me through all this; 
who are now gone for London.  It will be gladly received by me to
hear how it is with Friends in the north, and what way G. Fox 
passes -- I am a brother and companion to all that love 
righteousness.  Farewell in the Lord

Loveing Friends:  I have heard something of yr absenting 
yourselves from ye Meetings of ye Lords Servants yor fellow 
prissoners, which to understand did even bring trouble upon my 
Spiritt, becaus I am Jealous that that which leads you to such a 
Seperation with alsoe alienate you from ye Love, Life & power of 
God which is manifested among his Servants, as it hath done 
others that have given way unto it: & conisder how sadd it would 
be if you who suffer for one testimonie & for one Case as I may 
say, should be ensnared & prevailed against by ye Enemies & soe 
should come to be Exitinded? out of ye unity in Spirit with those
with whom ye suffer, ? I desire ye to be Circumspect & with ye 
Spiritt of ye Ld God fully & perfectly to prove & try that 
Spiritt which leads you from that ? you yrselves have found soe 
power & presented of ye Ld God to you refreshment. I mean in ye 
assemblies of ye Ld Chosen, & therefore ought ye not to forsake 
them, nor absent yourselves from them nor to appeare in them as I
have understood Richard that thou dost vizt with Spinning 
Instrument, which thing I beleeve is neither of God nor from God 
the Father I feare an Imagination conceived in thy own mind, 
which is not to Edification but hurtfull & prejditiall to them 
that waites upon ye Lord by troubleing them by draweing out theyr
Eye & mind through thy workes grieving & offending of them 
thereby, as I belieeves some of thyu fellow pre[isoners?]are 
through thy soe doeing neither is it a good Example or of good 
report or among ye world, neither will it I am pswaded bring 
Glory to God or [rubbed out] thy own soule, but be rather an 
occassion of reproach & stumbling.  Where I would desire the to 
desist from such worke at such inconvenient times & ? thy self to
thy worke in they own vineyard & pluck upp ye bryars & thornes 
there scratches & hurts ye tender vines, And then & there thou 
wilt find worke [tear] which will be needfuller & proffitabler & 
of better report then thy spinning [tear] Assemblies of ye 
Children of Light which I hope have noe needthereof for [tear] or
a testimonie to or against them, though sometimes ye like hath 
been don signe to or as a testimonie against this Generation in 
tehyr Idoll places of Idollatrous worshipp.  And Let not friends 
gentleness forbearance & long suffering theyr reprooving thee be 
an incouragement to thee in such a dissorderly & off? thing, but 
lay it rather aside as a thing which dahily may give offence not 
only to them that are without but also to ye Church in that 
Goale:  And be both pswaded to abide in your first Love. in your 
former station in ye ? & in yt which is profitable to 
Edicfication & of good repot & yt will be acceptable & well 
pleasing to ye Lord & then I doubt not but ye Lord will give ym a
good understanding in all things and preserve yem out of 
Extreames which is ye desire of your reall & faithfull friend,

Dear Margarent
My dear brother johan Stubbs is departed this country with 
cheerfulness, though in bodily weakness; he is accompanied with 
his desired companion Sam Fisher, who made little stay in 
Holland.  they are gone towards Rome.  I with another Friend 
brought them on their journey about fifty miles and then parted 
with them; the consideration of which parting caused tears 
several months before the time came, but how much more abundantly
were our hearts broken with the parting itself; which was indeed 
as if we should see the faces of one another no more in the 
outward;  They were desireous to have their dear love remembered 
to Friends in England.

John Hall is prisoner at Copenhagen in Denmark; he hath spoken 
with the King, and given him books, and I suppose a good sound is
sounded forth by him in that place.  It is like that he was taken
from his lodging and put in prison, and had many of his 
necessaries taken from him (as his shirt and other linen; but the
bearer hereof Humble Thatcher, may inform thee further concerning
particulars.  Farewell
Thine in the Lord

Notes: William caton to 
George Fox
Swarthmore the 20th of the 10th month 1659

Most Dearly Beloved and highly honoured in teh Lord
A little before my pressing into Scotland I wrote to thee, and 
gave thee in part to understand how it was, and had been with me,
and the same thing now comes upon me again to acquaint thee that 
I am (through mercy) well returned out of that nation, where the 
spirits of men were much set on fire, and they were I believe 
even at the height about my passing in, so that my cross was 
somewhat the greater, but then I felt so much the more of the 
pure life and power arise in me to carry me through all; so in 
confidence of the Lords everlasting faithfulness I went on and 
passed through the country (in which I had some good service) to 
Edinborough.  When I came there I heard of a General Meeting at 
Liethcoe to which I passed and there I found several Friends.  
It was reported that [General] Monck had given out an order to 
hinder the meeting, but there was little appearance of it; there 
were some rude people that would have done mischief hadnot the 
Lord restrained them, and the soldiers were much stirred up to 
threaten them.  From thence I returned ot Leith where I had 
several meetings, and often I was among the soldiers there and at
Edinburgh; but few of them came to our meetings excepting some 
few officers who did decline from Monck, and for the most part 
such were loving to Friends, for many there were that threw in 

their commissions while I was there, and several more [were] 
displaced, and great overturnings there were among them. And Few 
would come near us because people expected that some speedy 
course would have been taken with us, yet the Lord ordered things
far beyond expectation, and we enjoyed our meetings peaceably for
the most part of the time that I was there, but at that time the 
hearts and minds of people were so taken up with the bustlings 
and stirs that were amons the children of htis world, that there 
was scarce any room at all for the truth in them; but among 
Friends I had very good service, and the opportunity which I had 
among them was very seasonable and acceptable for they were but 
too apt to look out and consult what future trials might ensue 
the things that were then begun in the nation:  but some of them 
were bold and valiant, resting in confidence of the Lords 
faithfulness, who is the deliverer of the righteous out of all 
their tribulations.

I was over the water at Brunt Island, and there I had good 
service among some of the wisest of the Scots, who see the 
deceits of the priests.  Afterwards I passed westward towards 
Badcow, and very good service I met with in the way; some meeting
I had there among Friends; and likewise at, and about Heads.  
Friends there away keep their meetings indifferently orderly, but
constantly, there is or hath been little increase of late among 
them -- After I had had several meetings in the west I passed to 
Douglas, where I hadpretty good service, and there are a few that
keep their meeting, and some of them are pretty noble and valiant
for the truth.  Then I returned for England I left Stephen Crisp 
in the west among Friends who is a pretty wise man that came from
Colcheester, and he was determined to stay sometime in that 
nation.

When I was at Edinborough I endeavoured two or three times to 
speak with General Monck but could not have access to him, and 
therefore it came the more upon me to write to him and to the 
army.  And so it was, that I hope pretty well dispersed among the
soldiery who were respectful and courteous towards me.  When I 
was free of them, of Friends and the nation, I returned in much 
peace, having my reward, even in my bosom.  Glory and eternal 
praise be to the Lord God omnipotent for ever and ever.  I am at 
present at Swarthmore where I am through the goodness of the Lord
refreshed both in soul and body.

I have heard something of a General Meeting which is intended to 
be about the time called Easter, in Yorkshire, where I hope in 
the Lord to see thee, with many more of the brethren, even to my 
great refreshment in the Lord.  For a furhter account of passages
hereabouts I may refer thee to the bearer hereof, because he 
knows pretty well the state of things hereaways.  But however, I 
have thought good to give unto thee this brief account of 
passages, and withal to let thee know how it is with me at 
present; and so I rest in the Lord, not so much expecting as 
desiring to hear from thee.  Farewell

Dear and Abundatnly beloved
Since I came from London I have had exceeding good service in 
this county both at Sutton, Cranbrook, Tenderden, but especially 
at Staplehurst, and that in Tho Howsegoes family for it was so 
ordered that I came to his house the same day that he began to be
very ill -- he continued for several days but for the  most part 
he was very still, and a day or two before he died he gave a very
good testimony to the Truth, to the power, and to the glory that 
is now revealed etc. and when he departed, he was as if he had 
fallen asleep -- while he was sensible his care was very great 
over his wife, and those in his family that are in the Truth, and that more abundantly on the Truth's account, and for its 
advantage -- It was upon me to stay till his funeral was over, 
which was last third day, and abundance of Friends there were at 
it, yea several out of Sussex; so that it was a very honourable 
burial.  After his body was laid in the ground Friends drew into 
the meeting place, with several of the world, where we had an 
exceeding precious meeting, for hte power and presence of the 
Lord was abundantly manifested amongst us, to the consolation of 
Friends in general.  That night it was upon me to return to this 
house again where I had very good service:  in the morning I left
them, but assuredly he will be very much missed in those parts, 
and I believe there will be now more necessity of Friends 
visiting these parts pretty often [more] than there was before; I
desire that thou wouldst be mindful of them.

I have also been at Will Beames at Hyde, and Folkstone, where I 
find Friends very well, but some in deep suffering for that 
unhallowed ordination of tithes; some are in prison at 
Canterbury, and some in Dover castle for refusing to pay it.  
Yesterday I came to this town, and had a very good meeting 
yetsernight among Friends here, who are as well as ever I knew 
them.

Since I came to this town I have been to see for shipping, and 
here are some vessels ready to pass, and it is thought they might
set sail either this night or tomorrow at night, if the wind 
continue fair; and I purpose, if the Lord will, and I can get 
passage, to pass along with them to Zealand, and from thence to 
Holland -- Let thy prayers be for me, that I may be kept in the 
power of life and wisdom of our God to his eternal praise, and to
the comfort and consolation of the brethren
W. C.

Dearly Beloved:

Thine for Friends in Kent, and to myself I received, and 
certainly it was of service.  I did deliver it with my own hand 
to Thomas Howsegoe the last Third day, I being at a general 
meeting in Rochester, to which there came many Friends, and it 
was exceeding serviceable.  the countyr remains very open, and 
great desires there are in many after the Truth.  Some of the 
Baptists are come out of late about Sutton in Kent, where there 
are so many professors, but now they are much shaken, and the 
truth is over them.  There is much openness for the Truth also 
about Dover; and meetings there are very full and large, when any
of us are with them.  I have something upon me yet as towards 
that county, and therefore shall, if the Lord permit, step down 
into it again when I well can.

William Ames and Benj Furley are expected to be at London 
tomorrow if the Lord will; and their determination is, to pass 
over shortly for Holland, as far as I can understand.  The 
enclosed papers I received trom thence and seeing some service in
them as to Friends, did translate them, and some copies of them 
are gone abroad, and they beget a tenderness in Friends.  
Something was once with me, as to the printing of the substance 
of them, but I have chosed to forbear as yet, desiring first thy 
advice in the thing.  Humphrey Woolridge is returned from thence,
and he saith Friends are well in Holland, and their meetings 
pretty peaceable:  John Higgins yet remains among tem, but I 
suppose he may return soon after Will: Ames goes over.  Hen Fell 
is now set at liberty and is returned up to this city where it is
like he may stay a season, and therefore shall I be the more free
to leave this city for a time, and to visit some of the meetings 
in the country, for indeed there is much necessity elsewhere, as 
well as here; and the cry (in effect) come over and help us, is 
great in many parts of the nation; for indeed the harvest is 
great, and faithful labourers few in those parts.  My dearest 
love is with thee, and with all the faithful; farewell
Thine in Christ, W. C.

London the 7th of the 3rd Month 1660
Dear Friend
Our dear and unfeigned love reacheth unto thee, and to the 
brethren with thee, whom we dearly salute in the living Truth, 
and with the consideration of the refreshment which we hope 
Friends will have in them, and they in Friends; we are even 
thereby refreshed, and in their joy, which we hope is full, 
through their enjoyment one of another; we can rejoice in the 
Lord, who lifteth up our heads above the wickedness of wicked and
ungodly men, which indeed is grown to an exceeding great height 
in this city; which doth exceedingly aboud in pride, fulness, and
excess, and in all manner of superfluity of naughtiness, to the 
grieving of the spirits of just men, and to the making of their 
hearts sad that fear the Lord and wirk righteousness.

Yet nevertheless this we would have the brethren to know, that as
yet we see scarce any stop at all put to the work of the Lord, in
the city or country, for several precious meetings we had as we 
came through the country.  As a letter that is coming by the 
carrier makes mention of, more at large than at this time we 
shall do.  And as for the meetings in general in and nigh unto 
the city, they were the last First day as full, large and 
peaceable even almost as Friends have at any time known them; and
abundance of sober [torn] people resorted to them, and were 
generally quiet [torn] guard of soldiers which for a season were 
kept at the Bull and Mouth is now from thence removed, and 
several quiet, large and precious meetings we have had there of 
late, since the guard was removed, which is not only removed from
thence, but also from several parts of the city; and it is 
reported that the citizens would have all the soldiers of the old
army removed out of the city 40 miles, or rather disbanded, and 
they would undertake to guard and protect both the King and 
Parliament; the old soldiers are come in exceeding great 
contempt, and with the most of men they are holden in derision; 
and that dreadfulness which once attended them, is now departed 
from them, and others that dreaded them, are now become a dread 
unto them; and this is justly come upon them, which now in their
distress some of them will acknowledge.

Friends in the city are almost generally well [as] far as we 
know.  John Stubbs is gone into Kent; Richard Hubbertshorne is 
yet in the city.  The chiefest discourse among people here is 
about the King and the Parliament's proceeding, who are speedily 
preparing the way for his coming, which is suddenly expected; But
blessed be the Lord for ever, in whose power we can testify that 
our King is come, who reigns in power and great glory, and 
therefore need not we look for another.

[Robert Maylins] is to goe to Jamayca [Jamaica] ye first opertunity, and Ann Cleayton to New England, soe that hear will be great need of som[e] faithful labourers"; so many if the world come in that his stay has been longer then expected; (Postscript- [very faintly written]- appears to imply that Ann James of London knows where to send letters for him in Virginia and that it would be nice to "receve a few words ther[e] from thee")

Recieved an Epidtle from them "touching someting yt passesd at our Quarterly Meeting, 1680 [see numbers 46-49] at ye house of Ralph Fretwell wch was indirectly managed here and sent for England and elsewhere wthout our knowledge or consent wch we are sensible hath caused hurts and griefes wth us and griefe and trouble to you and other tender Friends"; as for the paper, "it was not sent abroad by us or our order...but was a griefe to us w[he]n we heard it was abroad and we jusged ye same ye first Quarterly Meeting after, otherwise called our Yearly Meeting at Rich[ard] Sutton's ye last first month [March], 1681, severall months before any notice from any other place touching it"; if they had intended to publish it or send it abroad, they would have "communicated it to some good Friend abroad (for approbation or service) wch we find ourselves clear of"; however some did gain it "or rather part of it" off of a particular Friend, which was to be read only, and yet "sent it privately abroad wth dislike...before giving notice of ye same"; at the last Quarterly meeting "ye 10th month [December], ye 13th day, 1681" held at Ral[ph] Fretwell's, the paper was ordered "to be taken out of our Quarterly Meeting book, and yo[u]r testimony unanimously submitted unto and placed in ye same instead...[and] we again did declare against spreading of it or any other papers yt might grieve or hurt any"; however one did seem "to justufie ...yt such papers might be sent abroad by ym yt did disapprove of ye same as he had done, wch Friend was not at ye Quarterly Meeting before at Ral[ph] Fretwell's or mentioned his sending it abroad, "Friends would have been more circumspect in making it,... for Friends did see and were sensible yt it was not only a griefe unto us, but unto some moderate men of ye world in the island yt some particulars amongst us were not so ready, as they might be, to hearken to ye advice of ye Apostle, 1 Cor[inthians], 6 ch[apter]"; admit that "we should have hinted...of ye great love, freedome, tenderness, brokenness and liberty yt was in yt said meeting expressed"; it was "a day of love and liberty and choice and not of constraint"; as for the paper "or short memorial, it was too short and not well expressed, more especially for such as was not at ye said meeting, and where it is expressed 'or whether you will give up unto ye judgm[en]t unto their own particular or particulars only' (wch is wrong copied), 'wth wch ye judgm[en]t generall of ye meeting have not unitie', it should also have been expressed, as it was ye sence of ye meeting (viz)' those particular judgm[en]ts wch have or were come unto a loss in ymselves, or have lost their beloved',...as the Scriptures testifie, and was spoke by us in ye meeting"; must emphasize that "as we expressed more large in ye Quarterly Meeting, for us to press upon Friends our public judgmt of ye Quarterly Meeting against any particular measure of ye spirit of God in any particular, were it our intention or practise or judgmt, it is by us judged as wrong wch was never in our hearts so to do, but to be helpful to ye dim sighted, lame, maimed ot strayed, we believe it is a Christian duty and practise"; are sorry for any grief they have caused; yet "as ye feare of ye living God is departed from yt Covenant of Light, ye Law of Jesus is cast behind ye back and ye day is darkned and full of clouds and mists, and ye more any wander from ye Father's house into ye by-wayes of their own inventions wch genders more into strife and other hurtfull lusts to ye disquiet of ymselves and ye heritage of God and ye derision of such as have not known ye Lord,...and if we or any other gives any judgm[en]t against this Light or ye least true measure if it in any, we go against ye univerall sp irit and wisesom of God wch alone ought to rule and govern to order all things in our men and womens meetings, and not ye judgmt of any men or women esteemed elders out of ye same spirit and measure of true Light in any particulat or particulars is wrong and judged by us"; a true copy examined by Rich[ard] Ford

Dear and very loving friend; my unfeighed love in the truth does 
salute thee very dearly.  I could not well omit by this occasion 
to let thee know the well-being of Friends here.  We had the last
week our Quarterly meeting, and that to the comfort and 
refreshment of one another, the Lord was with us, blessed be his 
name; all things were well and in unity amongst us.  As for hte 
general, it is well with Friends, for as much as I know, at 
Rotterdam, Haarlem, Alkmaar, Waterland, Friesland, Embden, 
Hamborough and Frederickstatt.  At Dantzich have three Friends 
laid down their bodies, some months since.  They are as yet not 
molested by their Magistrates; blessed be the Lord.  At the last 
Quarterly meeting was ordered that a letter of account should be 
sent to the next yearly meeting at London which I hope in due 
time shall be done.  Thy letter concerning spreading of Friends 
books, was again read in the meeting.  We have foun out a way to 
send not only books to Switzerland, but I hope to Peidmont among 
the Albijenses and Waldenses; in a week or so we intend to send 
thither a good parcel of Friend's book in the French Tongue, 
which is most used amonst them.  I hope thou hast received a pack
of German and Danish Friends books, which I have sent to S. 
Crisp; it seems they were taken by the searchers, but for as much
we have heard, many books of other languages, except in the 
English freely came in.

Many Friends have desired their dear love to be remembered to

In a weeck, 2 or 3, we intend to send thither a good percel of Fri[ends] books in the French tongue which is most usual amongst them. I hope thou hast received a pack of Germans and Deens [Danish?] Fr[iends] books which I have send to S[teven] Crisp. It seems they were taken by the searchers but for as much we have heard ma[n]y books of other languages except in the Englissh [English] freely come in"; many Friends send love including "my and my dear wife's [Elizabeth] love" and that of B[arent] v[an] Tongeren, John Roclofs [Roelofs], John and Jacob Claus and their wives; also "our neighbour that carrys hereself very friendly towards us desired...to be remembred to thee"; "Salute Friends that make enquiry of us"

Is writing to let him know "the welbeing of Friends here"; the past week, "we had...our quarterly meeting...[and] all things were well"; generally "it is well with Friends...at Rotterdam, Haarlem, Alckmaar [Alkmaar], Waterland, Vriesland, Emaden [Emden], Hamborough [Hamburg] and Frederikstatt [Friedrichstadt, Germany ((Denmark is written in above Germany--CW))]" while at Danzig 3 Friends have "laide down their bodies in some months time' but as yet "they are...not molested by the magistrats"; the past Quarterly Meeting ordered "that a letter of account should be send [sent] to the next yearly meeting at London...which I hope that in due time shall be done. Thy letter concerning spreading of Friends books is again read in the meeting. We have found out a way to send not only books to Switserland [Switzerland], but hope to send also to Piemont [Piedmont] amongst the Albigenses and Waldenses. In a weeck, 2 or 3, we intend to send thither a good percel of Fri[ends] books in the French tongue which is most usual amongst them. I hope thou hast received a pack of Germans and Deens [Danish?] Fr[iends] books which I have send to S[teven] Crisp. It seems they were taken by the searchers but for as much we have heard ma[n]y books of other languages except in the Englissh [English] freely come in"; many Friends send love including "my and my dear wife's [Elizabeth] love" and that of B[arent] v[an] Tongeren, John Roclofs [Roelofs], John and Jacob Claus and their wives; also "our neighbour that carrys hereself very friendly towards us desired...to be remembred to thee"; "Salute Friends that make enquiry of us"

to George Fox
Newgate the 9 of 12 month 1660
Dear Geo;
Thou may understand that we here at this side of the prison have 
given some reasonable payment for hte place where we are, it 
being very serviceable in divers respsects to us, and the truth, 
and that not a little in our privilege to have such fine sweet 
meetings here, as we have ahd.  Now it is so, that sundry persons
here are, that seem to be dissatisfied with giving of money to 
the goaler etc. though I believe that such as have a good 
understanding in the matter cannot according to truth, speak 
against it.

Now, dear Geo;, a few words from tehe touching htis matter would 
be very effectual I believe to the bringing of all into one 
consent, which is to be sought after amongst friends.  Little 
else at present; only Friends are generally well, and their dear 
love is to thee.  I received a letter from W. Caton last night; 
he was very well, and Friends with him; his dear salutation is to
all the bretheren

Thine in the truth
John Higgins

The following is endorsed on this letter by George Fox
GF his answer:
"If you do hire a room to keep a meeting in of the goaler, and
for people to come to hear the truth, it will be well to give him
something in your own power, for the Lord and his truth's sake, 
and the convincing of people."

Received his "in answer to mine formerly sent, and though but answered in part, yet am very well satisfied therewith, as from one yt (I doe beleive) does truly desire the peace and prosperitie of ye apearance of yt glorios day...and if I had not knowne thee to be a faithfull minister of ye everlasting Gospell, I should not have so wrote to thee as I then did, but never complained on my owne acco[unt], nor had I not bene an eye wittness yt much more violence was yn ought to be amongst Christians, I had never out pen to paper, but I hope in God yt more moderation will be used for ye tyme to com[e] amongst us, for such procedings has but produced hardness in those whom tenderness would have oversom[e]. Before Soloman Eccles went away , he very much endevered to make peace amongst all Friends in ye Island [Barbados] and if he [h]ad had tyme I believe he would in a good measure a brought it to pass", but there are too many who do not desireit; hopes that in time "they will see their error"; John Rous, both publicly and privately, has interceeded in order "yt all former animossities might cease"; unfortunately, "som[e] has too much obstructed those propositions"; hopefully the Lord will open "their and every ones understandings"; as for the books of W[illia]m Rogers, "they doe litle or noe hurt heare" since few Friends "knows that heare is any such bookes"; however, a Bristow [Bristol] man "brought 10 of ym, and som[e] yt was gone from yt wch they had professed got ym and shews ym to others, but ye moderate lookes upon it...only to be som[e] peice of revenge, so it is as if now such booke[s] had even bene"; he [Oliver Hooton] is now going "to see ye new countreys of New Jarsey [New Jersey] and Pensilvania [Pennsylvania]" but not to settle there: hopes to be back "befor[e] ye yeare expires"' "Love to thee, my deare Friend, whom in my heart I have both loved and honored...and yt deservedly from ye first, and if any pretend adoration to any man (tho never so holy) are but falce flaterers of yt person wch I know thou would reprove in any, tho som may cast aspertations, wch I hope I shall never have cause to beleive"

When they were together he told her that a "pure light...was ariseing in me...yet I c ould not beleeve [it] because I felt no such thing,...but now I know thou hast ye anoynting of the Holy one and thou knowes all things"; therefore, "thou art my owne heart [and] my soule lyes in the bosom"; she was in "thicke darkeness...when thou cam[e] into these parts" although she had once "allmost escaped ye delucions of the world" by walking "as ye preist said and not as they did"; however, "when I cam[e] to be aquented wth them and was allwayes complayning of the weight of sine wch I felt dayly troubling me and was a burthen to[o] heavie for me to beare, they tould me every one had their faylings,...and I seeing their loseness [looseness], I toke more libertie to walke more lowsely yet trouble did remain when I did com[m]itt the least sin till I got [John] Saltmarch['s] 'Of Christ's blood flowin out freely to sinners' [Free Grace: or the Flowings of Christ's Blood freely to Sinners; Wing S484]...[which] did set out Christ dyeing at Jerusalem dyeingg for siners as siners, and upon that I toke libertie to walke in sin, and there I lost my condicion"; sees it plainly now; her life dwells in him and she loves him dearly and would fane to see his face if he should come "to the heade [?] of Lankeshire [Lancashire] ot to Sedbare [Sedbergh, in Yorkshire]" and if so, he should "get me word" and she would "com[e] to thee of a day, for my litle one [apparently a daughter] cannot be wthout the brest of the night"; Rebecke [Rebecca] Ward "is well in mesure in her condicion, but she hath strong temptations to returne backe.

Contents:
Since the last time “I was with ye...I have had more command over my thoughts then ever I had
before and how the enemy comes every way to draw my mind out”; she is in such thick darkness
“that the pure voyse is not known without much fightinge, such is the strenth of the enemy”; asks
that he pray that she “may wayte in fayth and obedience...till the vayle be rent from the top to the
botome” so that she may know Ch[rist]; however, since her childhood, she has known greater
temptations then any she has ever met “to wit, that their was no God and that the Scripture was
geven out by the reson [reason] of men and that all thoase visible things which we se[e] with our

eyes weare by nature”; such temptations “toke [took] hould when I was readinge any thing that
convinced me of sin,...and feare and trembleing toke hould on me so that I durst not stay, but cast
away the booke I was readinge of and run amongst other childeren to play or any way to git shut
of it, and now when the power of the Lord cones, the same tentation [temptation] is not
wantinge, for as I was comeinge the last time I was with the[e], the same temptation cam[e] by
litle and litle till I was so darkened that I knew not how I was...[and] the Tempter went on till at
last I had som[e] pease”; again asks that he pray for her so that she may be able “to stand agaynst
adversary”

Has been “a month and upward with J.A.

I was begune to declare beofr they came”; continued to speak for 3 hours and “they satt like dead men”; finally, “when I had cleared my selfe clearely, I stode halfe a quarter of an hower, and not a word came from the prests, in that if one of their folowers had not asked a question I beleve they would have gone away and not opened their mouths, but then they gott a litle up and…desputed about an hore [hour]. As for their asertions, if I had time to relat[e] them unto the[e], they would make the[e] mery, but in this, I shall forbear att present, but they went away with shame”; at Durham, “ we had a great meting and att Darnton [Darlington?], att Bowdan [possibly Great Burdon], Heighington, Shotten [Shotton], Carltion [Carlton] and Stockedan [Stockton-on-Tees]”; had a large general meeting at Gisbrough [Guisborough, in Yorkshire] to which came “many Freinds…of the woales [Wolds] 40 or 50 miles, and abundance of the world”; at Nothalerton [Northallerton] “we had a larg meting and at Richmond [in Yorkshire], and yesterday we had a metting at Houghton in the Spring [Houghton-le-Spring] within 4 miles of Darham [Durham]. it lay upon us to cume backe to itt agayne. The prest and people is falen out. Their was above a thousand people, and we had made such a sound in the cuntry with meting that the adversaries wheir sore greved and the comissioners had given order to breake the meting, and the asisses [assizes] being att Durham also, they sayd they wear a[f]rayd of sume insurection, and so their came a party of horse [and] wear declaring…[and] they stayed calmely and heard 5 or 6 hores [hours], and so we broke up the meting in peace and jpy”; Humphrey N[orton] “is come into this county [and] he was with John [Audland] and me att 3 metings, but spoke not, but only one day about 3 words. He is darke and subtill and bad, so att or near our parting, I spoke to him how I had receved ketters from beyond the sea and how [he] had done hurte and bad[e] him declared how things was if he was fre[e], so he tould us all or most of your pasiges their. We lett him se[e] his fol[l]y, but he is hard and bad…He sayd he wpuld be with us the last first day, but he was not but he went into Cleveland, we being come out of it. His enmity is greatt agaynst G.F. [George Fox]. He sayd thou was more moderate to him in the end then thou was att the forst, as though thou had repented of wahtt thou had sayd to him, but he gathers things to keep up himself above judgment. I was att Anthony Pearson’s one night”; the latter had become wicked which is a pity for “there is a good thing in him” if only he “did keep out of the worlds spirite, for that betrayes him and hurts him. However, att present he is low and diligent at metings and beares a good strok[e] in the cuntry if he did but keep in god’s dominion. Heare is a greatt noyse in this cuntry of a rising, but as yet all is quiete, butt the prests hatcheth mischeife into peoples minds. There is 5,000 up in Lankishire [Lancashire] which ine [ Sir George] Bouth [Booth, first Baron Delmamere] and Coll[onel] [Gilbert?] Ireland heads by the instigation of the prests.

Was comforted and refreshed “in thy company when I had the oppertunity to speak wth thee once or twice in London”; unfortunately when he [G.F.] went into the country, “I was them almost uncapable to vissit thee, being altogether a stranger to those parts, soe yt without a guide it was hard for mee to finde the way”; acquainted some Friends in London “yt I had a desire to see thee before I went to Maryland, but I perceived theire occations could not permit theire goeing just at yt time, yet once I gott a pilote to Edward Mann’s country house where I hoped to meet the[e], but thou was gone from thence”; would not have troubled him with this, “butt…I was not clearly satisfied in my owne minde yt I did no[t] see thee againe before I went, the ship goeing something sooner then expected”; however “I did wright a few lines to thee wch in thy letter to us thou signifies thee did receive, but as to the memorandum yt the[e] left and now have sent us conver[n]ing the books, I doe not remember yt I ever saw it until I see it here in Maryland, but however as it happened, I did pretty well comply wth it, for some of thy primers I carried and several books of the Statutes in Breviates, and for answers to the dirty books wright agt Friends, I doe think most Friends in these parts have of them and I doe not remember yt I ever heard of any of them dirty books yt ever was brought into these parts (ex[c]ept one of [William] Rogers) and yt was kept soe close yt Freinds could never gett it although sought for it to destroy it”; Friends have received “thy severall letters sent this yeare, wth the inclosed condemnations, Epistles and acco[unts] of proceedings in our behalfe wth ye L[or]d Baltimore, and thy last wth the King’s [James II] order to the Mayor of London. Wee are in hopes it will be of service here. Our last mo[nthly] meeting have apoynted some Freinds to goe and discoarse those yt are cheife in authority here and to lay our conditions of suffering once more before them and to lett them see as many of those inclosed papers thou sent us… and when wee have rec[eive]d theire answere and resolution thou may expect Freinds here will give thee a full acco[unt] of all theire proceeding”; they all acknowledge his [G.F.] care and labour “for our inward and outward prosperrity” and God will reward him

For Friends at the Second day Meeting

Dear Friends and Brethren in the blessed Seed of Life which is 
one in all, according to [our] measure, in which we are near and 
dear one unto another, and in a fresh remembrance of you, at this
time, I do dearly salute you all, dear brethren and fellow 
labourers in teh gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And now dear 
friends, it being our desire to hear often one from another, of 
your well being, and of Truths prosperity; by these you may 
understand, I have been at Frederihstadt, where I stayed eight 
days:  Friends wer every glad of that visit we had good service 
and four public meetings in the meeting house; abundance of 
people, more than the house could hold came; and several came to 
us after the meeting and said that they had received more 
satisfaction than ever they had done in all their life time with 
hearing the priests.  We had also a good meeting in the country, 
besides private meetings at Friends' houses.  There is a great 
openness in that place.  We went to Hamburgh; there are but 
little [few] there, yet we got a meeting that same day, and had 
about fifteen [present].  The next day we came away and came to 
Embden, and had a little meeting there, and so on to Friesland.  
At Harlingen there is a pretty little meeting; we had two good 
meetings there, and several came in and seemed to be well 
saitsfied; so the truth gets ground an dgains upon the people.  
At Amsterdam abundance come to the meetings on first days, and 
the Lords power is overall, blessed for ever.  I have several 
places yet to visit, in these parts, and I do not know but that I
must go to Friesland again.  Friends are generally well in all 
these parts. My love to you all, in the seed of life that reigns 
over all, God blessed forever

Notes: An Epistle from Amsterdam in Holland dated the 25th of the 3rd
mo 1688
To the Elders and Brethren in the Truth gathered togethe rin your
yearly Meeting in the city of London

Dearly Beloved in Christ Jesus, being very sensible of that 
blessed universal spirit that God has poured forth upon you, and 
in which you gather together, to take notice of the concerns of 
Gods blessed truth, and the conditions of all the Churches of 
Christ Jesus that are in teh Restoration and gathered together 
out of the apostacy, where soever settled in the whole world.

Our tender salutations in the springings of life everlasting in 
teh midst of us, livingly goeth forth towards you, wishing tha 
the presence of the living God, whom you serve, may gloriously 
manifest itself amongst you, to the filling of you abundantly 
with his heavenly spirit of wisdom, of life, of strength and 
concord:  that you may be so enabled thereby to perform so great 
a service as you are called unto, as that in the end you may 
every one of you, feel and enjoy his proper reward from God to 
your perfect satisfaction in Him; and He have the universal 
praise and glory and thanks of all universally, for to Him it 
belongs.

And Friends whereas it doth not appear that it will be convenient
for any one of our Friends and brethren in this Continent that 
speak the English tongue, to come to you at this present time of 
your Yearly meeting aforesaid, it was the desire of Friends 
universally that you might be acquainted by writing, of the state
of Truth's concerns in these countries, and of every meeting in 
particular.  Wherefore you may know that Friends generally and 
all the meetings in these provinces and also in the East as at 
Dantzic, Frederickstadt, Hamborough and Embden, continue in a 
friendly and brotherly correspondence together and all quiet in 
their several places, both within themselves and also in respect 
of the Magistrates:  all enjoying their meetings, to wait upon 
and to worship God according to his will, peaceably:  for which 
great mercy, we desire we may be thankful, and walk always worthy
of.  And as for Dantzic in particular they living farthest from 
us outwardly, and so having least of the enjoyment of the outward
company and visits of their friends and brethren from other 
places; are the greatest objects your sympathy of any of the 
above mentioned meetings; and that for so muchthe more as their 
number is but small, not exceeding the number of twelve, and most
of them not much experienced, yet they are very ready to acquaint
the Quarterly Mettings here with their affairs, and to receive 
their advice, which keeps things sweet and in good order amongst 
them.  They are all very low as to the world, and several are not
in a condition yet, since their last imprisonments and 
banishments, to live without our assisting them from time to 
time.  Their loves is dearly desired by them to be remembered to 
you; and they also desired you might be acquainted that they 
greatly long to be visited by some Friends or Friends that has 
received a gift from God for their edification, and the spreading
of Gods truth.

The Friends of truth at Frederickstadt, lying a great deal nearer
this way are oftener visited and blessed be the Lord, altho' 
their number doth hardly amount to 20 yet truth hath gotten a 
good ground there, so that it is in a measure grown honorable 
even among them that are without, and it is sweetly felt to live 
among them that sugest? confess? posess? it.
 
At Hamborg there continues a meeting of three honest sensible 
persons, one man and two women

At Embden there continues 2 men and 2 women that most constantly 
keeps up the meeting -- some others there are who adhere to the 
truth who by reason of infirmity doth not come there so 
constantly; but yet are honest to their measures of convincement

In the Palatinate there is one only and very ancient friend left.
And at Crevelt a man & his wife professing truth, all the rest of
both places, being gone to Penna. some time ago.

In Friesland there continues 3 mtgs, as one and the chief at 
Harlingen, and two in a bye place of that county called the 
Wonda, known to several public friends of your nation; both of 
htese meetings continue much as they were last year as within 
themselves, but at one of them called Knype, very few strangers 
come into the meeting of late when a publick friend comes there. 
At Harlingen things are well, and Friends in a good esteem with 
many of their fellow citizens, etc.

At Rotterdam there is a seed a little that honours God, and that 
God has a respect to, and which we hope the Lord will raise up 
more and strengthen in his own time with an addition, thought 
there are also such as make not the use of God's truth that they 
ought to do.

At Haarlem, there is a meeting kept up, and things pretty quiet 
among them.  And at Alkmaen there remains as yet a small meeting 
of two men and two womenFriends?

And now lastly as to this place (viz) Amsterdam, we live in peace
and concord among ourselves, adn also among our neighbours, 
enjoying our meetings peaceably, only sometimes some rudeness 
appears from some wild young men that care not how they bring a 
reproach upon themselves even in the world.  Our first, Fourth 
and Fifth day meetings are kept diligently, as Friends have no 
important hindrances from coming to them; and the Lord's good 
presence is amongst us to the gladdening of our hearts.

Our 1st? days and Monthly Quarterly and Yearly Mens and Womens 
meetings are also duly observed, and in unity.  And our next 
yearly meeting to be on the 28 of the 4 mo next coming English 
account; at which we are in hopes to see some Friend or Friends 
fromamongst you, if it be the will of the Lord.

In our first day meetings we have consistantly pretty many 
strangers from many places of the world; and the Lord is with us 
and his blessed truth (in a good measure) in dominion; and our 
desires to him is in fervency of spirit that He who hath begotten
in us a hunger and thirst and longings for the prosperity and 
spreading and dominion o fhis everlasting glorious truth in these
nations, may be pleased to arise yet more and more to answer our 
prayers and expectations from Him.  And so we conclude in dear 
and tender love, and the blessed fellowship of truth as it is in 
Christ Jesus, and in teh joy of God's salvation with you, that He
hath wrought in this our age and day.  Blessed and praised be teh
Lord for evermore.

He reads them “in the Light of the New Covenant” where he is present with them “though absent
in body”; they have all been found worthy by God “of this high calling”; received the letter they
sent from Camebridge [Cambridge] ; “I shortly went into the Isle of Eley [Ely] and I had
meetings at Eley Towne and was moved to goe to the steeple, but the rude people would not
suffer mee to speake, but...I was preserved and I had a great meeting in ye towne yt day” and
many were convinced; However “ the towne is much hardended ageanst the Truth”; yet there is
“a preety people a coming on at Litleport [Littleport] in the Isle” where he remained “a cirtayne
space among them, and there is about 60 yt are brought to meet togather alone in yt towne”, one
of whom was “moved to go naked and to go so to a captayne’s house, an Independent professrt,
and the towne was much inraged ans set him in ye stockes all night;” on the following first day,
“I had a meeting at a place called Soam [Soham], within 3 miles of Collon [el Francis] Rus[se]
ll’s and ther I was moved to goe to the steeplehouse and there was a London priest gotten up into
ye seate of ye Pharisy and hee was right pharisy, for hee was much paynted”; stayed there till he
had finished “and then I was caried out in a mighty power to speake to him and to ye
people...and they was a very great people and rude, but yw power of God was wonderfully
seene...and the throng was great, soe I pressed forth into the yard and there they made way for
mee ans I was moved to speake... and they stood even like lambes about me,and at last there
came one Rob[ert] Hamond [Hammond], called a justice, who had beene at the steeplehouse and
hee sayd yt there was a Proclamation [given forth by Oliver Cromwell on 15 February, 1654/5]
yt all who disturbed ye minister in ye time of his publique exersise should bee aprehended as
disturbers of the peace, so if I would not passe away,...i should bee aprehended, so I was free to
passe from yt place, but I tould him ans ye people yt I should declare ye Truth in ye towne yt
day”; in fact, “I had a greate meeting in the towne yt day” where several “of ye people yt
belonged to those people [Independents?] at Chipnam [Shippenham, in Cambridgeshire]” but
apparently there were “none yt came out of the towne”; however, those that were there “received
ye Truth willingly” and many were convinced, “and there was a man yt was moved to come from
Littleport and stand naked among ye people in ye meeting...but I knew nothing of it untill it was

dunne [done], and many of ye world stumbled and ye enimy gotte some advantage there, but ye
people was much silent and quiet, though there was some startleing smong them of ye world”,
yet many were well satisfied “who had a capacity to receive”; however all of this “went to
Hamond’s [Hammond’s] eare” and he and the priests consulted “and ye next morning hee sent a
warren[t] for mee and comitted mee to Cambridge gaole for speakeing to the priest”; was sent to
Cambridge “on ye last 2d day” and was put into “ye low gaole among[s]t ye theives, and on ye
next day, justice [James] Blackley sent his warrant and set mee free...of his owne accord”; on
the next day “I went to a meeting six miles from Cambridge where I met with...An[n] Blakely
[Blaykling] and Dorathy [Dorothy] Waugh” who remain in those parts; his [Parnell] release and
going into the country was serviceable “for ye heathen was much excalted [exhalted] and
rejoyced at my imprisonment”; intends to pass “shortly bake [back] into those partes where I was
taken, for ther is a people there to bee brought forth”; heard that Russille’s [Colonel Francis
Russell] “was then at London, but ye heathen...is plotting together to gett mee into prison ageane,
for ye gaoler hath beene with Blackley about it and is trubled in mind because hee let mee go
without bayle and threatens to gette anohter warrant for mee”; is content whether in or out of
bonds “but I have thoughtes to bee heare aboutes untill ye next returne, if you have moveinges to
write anything”; [James] Jolly [Jollie], “ye scoller [scholar], is come to ye towne, but hee is in
litle servisse. Hee is come to see about some meanes yt is due to him in ye Colledge [Trinity
College, Cambridge], for they have not yet put him out and hee hath gotten some monies of
them”; love to G.F. [George Fox] and “I shall bee glad to heare from George or any of you”

Dear G. Fox

My heart is exceedingly drawn forth towards the whole flock of 
God, desiring nothing more htan that Sion may prosper, and that 
the glory of the Lord may more and more arise upon her sons and 
daughters, that in that glory they may daily more and more arise 
and shine forth to his eternal praise, over the face of the whole
earth.  The prophet of the Lord of old complained, saying 
"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of
hte Lord revealed"; But now, glory be to the Lord God forever 
more, his faithful servants and messengers can say "Behold me 
adn the children which thou hast given me," though at the 
present they be counted as signs and wonders.  But it shall not 
always be so.

And now as concerning that great message which I wrote to thee 
about, and came to London to confer with thee concerning; this 
much I have to say, that in the truth and integrity of my heart, 
I am freely given up to stand in the will of the Lord, and as way
is made for me in the eternal wisdom so to proceed.  I see 
nothing as yet but that all things work so as to clear my way to 
that service, both within and without.

There is on Ralph Goldsmith, a Friend, and master of a ship, his 
house is in Jacob Street near Savory's Dock, near Ratcliff who 
hath taken a [not clear] for Venice.  There came a young man to 
me upon the Charing when I was last in London and imformed me 
thereof; I had freedom to go and find him out, who also told me 
it was so, and that [it] might likely depart the city in twenty 
one days.  Now this much I have freedom may be done.  Let him be 
sent to and agreed with for a passage to that place which may 
come on board in the Downs, and let some directions be sent what 
way after may best be taken, and some letters of credit for 
supplies of money, and let him send word to Luke HOwwards of his 
coming down, and of his arrival in teh Downs.

Wein [.....] the 13 of the 2d month 1662

My dearly beloved brother,
Hereby thou mayst understand that I with my companion (of whom I 
have said nothing yet) came safe last night to Wein, and verily I
can truly say he was given me of the Lord to be my companion in 
travel.  He came with me from Amsterdam, being truly moved 
thereunto of the Lord in himself without any motion thereto 
either from me, or any Friend, and verily the Lord hath herein 
more fully answered my desire then I sedired, he fully answering 
what is wanting in me in reference to divers particulars wherein 
he hath been made truly and honestly serviceable to me; the Lord 
hath made him as it were my passport through divers cities and 
garrisons, through all which our Father hath hitherto led us, as 
innocent lambs through the midst of dark dens of cruel beasts of 
prey; His holy name is alone worthy of all the praise, who I 
trust will never leave us nor forsake us.  My companion hath been
very serviceable divers others ways, as in reference to the 
several ports and value of money, and for directions in the way, 
and also hath been instrumental in conveying divers books and 
copies of thy papers to divers of the Lords and great ones as we 
passed along, as also to the prince of Salzburgh.  He is a 
Scotchman and hath understanding in four or five other languages,
and a Friend, of whose coming Wm. Ames did approve.  We intend if
the Lord will to pass onward this day if opportunity present and 
I trust that the same arm of protection and preservation will 
still compass us about which hath already been hitherto with us, 
let us not be forgotten by thee, my true love is to thee, which 
also floweth towards the whole flock and family of our Father, 
desiring that the glory of the Eternal may mroe and more arise 
daily on them, and that in it alone the whole body may more and 
more arise and shine forth to His eternal praise. This is the 
third letter I have written to thee since I came from England:  I
would that Friends at Dover may know that I am indifferent well 
at the date hereof.
Thy unfeigned Brother
John Philley

Endorsed:

is possibly by George Fox]

Contents:
“I lately writ a letter to thee, G.W. [George Whitehead] and A.P. [Alexander Parker] wherein I
gave you an acc[oun]t of my rec[eip]t of y[o]ur answer [for this answer, see Thomas Crisp, The
First Part of Babel’s-Builders Unmasking Themselves; Wing C6951, pp. 4-5] to the Quarterly
Meeting’s paper [for this paper, which was subscribed by 82 men and women Friends of
Barbados on 23.x.1680, see Thomas Crisp’s , The First Part etc., p.4] and yt it was read at our
last Quarterly Meeting at Ralphs Fretwel’s [Fretwell’s] and that there was a generall submission
to y[o]ur judgement on the paper and yt the paper was taken out of the booke and your answer
put in the place. Also I advised you how Jo[h]n Weale proposed the giving forth of a paper of
condemnation wch upon some discourse with him since, I doe understand he did not intend for
all the subscribers, but only for R.F. [Ralph Fretwell] who drew ye paper. I doe understand yt
some Freinds in England have judged that he hath been hardly dealt with, both in taking the
meeting from his house and in Freinds in England have judged that he hath been hardly dealt
with, both in taking the meeting from his house and in Freinds withdrawing at other times.
W[he]n the meeting was there, Freinds found it was an opportunitie of those who were not well
affected to Truth getting together and uttering their prejudice ag[ain]st Freinds and it was hard to
have a friendly correspondencie with him at other times without being frequently troubled with
hearing his discontents ag[ain]st diverse Freinds, but yt if Freinds have been short or anything to
hard heretofore, yt noe meanes might be left untryed wher[e]by to bring him into unitie, they
offered for a tryall to remove a meeting (neerby) to his house and to passe by and overlooke all
yt was past, and if he could not bury all without some further satisfaction in discourse, when his
spirit was coole and love uppermost, they would would be willing to have a meeting with him
and discourse things with a desire of his satisfaction, but he doth not seeme inclinable to any
motion yet made to him. His prejudice seemes to be most ag[ain]st R.F., and it is thought he
would overlooke all besides and R.F. hath appeared very desirous to remove the prejucice, but
J.W. [John Weale] is not willing to joyne with him in it”; a book has some there entitled Babel’s
Builders Unmasking Themselves [by Thomas Crisp; Wing C6948] “wherin are many reflections
both on the paper written here and your answer [the paper and answer appear on pages 5-7] wch
hath been of some service, for by it some who were violent saw how...they came to those bad
spirits yt writ it, and how they agred in their reflections, wch I had something upon my spirit to
write an answer to and sned here enclosed [see number 47], leaving it to the judgm[en]t of thee
and Freinds to alter w[ha]t you may see convenient, or whether to print it or not [apparently it
was not printed], for I suppose Freinds in England, not knowing the end and intent in writing it,
though very charitable in answering it, could not be soe possitive in stopping that flood of
aspersions cast upon Truth by neanes of it, as one yt was present and heard and saw all yt Truth
is concerned in answering it, yt those bould aspertions cast on Truth may be wiped of[f]. We
[Rous, his wife, Margaret [nee Fell, jr], and children] have a great desire to goe to England and
doe thinke to begin our voyage about the beginning of the 3d month [May], but if my busines
will not permit me, I thinke my wife [Margaret] and children may goe and I may follow” ;
Christopher Newham “is come hither, but doth not appear well pleased, neither doe I understand
he concernes himselfe as formerly” ; R.F. [Ralph Fretwell] intends to go to England “this year’
and will leave “his son Ralph in his busines”; uncertain at present, but they may all go together;
“I hope in time things may be well here, for since the proposing of a generall unitie, meetings are
much fresher yn [then] they have bin”; wife [Margaret] and children are well “’and our duty is
presented to thee and my mother [Margaret Fell]”; (Postscript- “If thou writes to me about any
publick concernes of Truth, direct thy letter for me or in my absence for Joseph Borden, who is a
very honest Freind”)

In a preface to the reader, Rous notes that the occasion for Crispe's [Crisp's] book was "a paper written at a Quarterly meeting in Barbados intended to gather into the initie of God's holy spirit and to exclude nothing but yt renting and dividing spirit wch...would oppose the universall spirit of God" confesses that he was "not active in the promoting [of] it,...but finding yt envy and mallice hath taken occasion at ye shortnes in wording of it and high reflections are cast, not only on the persons immediately concerned, but upon the tender reproofes and advice of those Freinds who answered it and also upon Freinds in generall, as if by this paper a discovery were made of some secreet designe (under the pretence of men and womens meetings) to embondage and bring into slavery those who are subject to ye wholesome advice rec[eive]d from those meetings,... I am engaged in my spirit to write something to clear the innocent in this matter"; the purpose of the paper "was to establich concord and exclude the spirit of discord,... and was managed without force or compulsion,... and the personby whose meanes it came to be divulged had a coppie to consider of before he joyned in it, wch he carrying to some who having little love for Truth, thinking they had a great occasion agst Freinds...sent it to London to some...bad or worse spirits, who have not spared to make the worst of it"; the latter have not acted for the good of the Truth or else they would not "in soe publick a place as Gracechurch street meeting to have exposed it to the sight and hearing of such an assembly, or by printing to have exposed it to the view of all"; the book they brought forth [Babel's Builders unmasking Themselves] is "stuffed with perversions, slanders, lies, confusion and contradictions" : [Rous now begins his paper entitled. "Envy and mallice Displayed in their Propper Colours"]; attacks Crisp's argument that the paper was promoted by G.F.'s [George Fox's] party; although in the preface [of Babel's Builders] "it is said the intent of publication of this ensuing paper and letter...is not to reflect upon or reproach in generall the people called Quakers or in contempt of their principle, yet it doth appear yt ye mallice is soe great yt none yt keep to and abide in the practice of their principle shall escape, ye incectives are soe generall, and they you are most sparing towards are those of your owne spirit, who though they may be called Quakers, yet are departed from and stand in opposition to the life and power"; they are in fact "seperates, stubborne Caines [Cains], Judas's [and] apostates"; as for what is quoted from Is[aac] Pennington [Penington] and Edw[ard] Burrough in the preface [of Babel's Builders], "take their words as they were written without perversion, and there is noe disagreem[en]t between w[ha]t they have written and we practice"; as for the paper itself " a coppie wherof you have printed, but not agreeable to the originall, wch you say in abhorrencie wherof other persuasions have posted,...it may be they might set it up there to publick veiw as yours also was set up in a bad house, yet this doth nothing but denote the prejudice of ym yt did it"; the paper "was not worded soe aptly or full as it should have been wherby to demonstrate the sincere intentions of those who subscribed it,...but though I was present and heard the whole matter discoursed, I did not hear nor understand anything was intended but the promoting the practicall part of Christianitie without constraint in love and unitie to walke and act sccording to the universall spirit of God"; this is "according both to Scripture and ye principle at first oreached among us" or to draw any from it "but to prevent the abuse to many put upon it, who pretend they are guided by it when they act contrary to it"; it is reasonable "in things yt are dubious or not sufficiently expressed, that every man should be the interpreter of his owne words and not as you have done by this paper to strain the tearmes beyond w[ha]t in reason they will bear"; since the paper was drawn and subscribed "there hath been noe use made of it to the prejudice of any nor answerable to y[ou]r mallicious surmises though it was neer a year before we either rec[eive]d the sence of Freinds concerning it or saw w[ha]t ill use was made of it in y[o]ur booke"; they [Crisp et al] "are not satisfied only in casting y[o]ur abusive aspersions on the paper, but you also vilifie and abuse the Freinds who writ the answer [ George Fox, Alexander Parker, and George Whitehead] ...[who] were (without doubt) both sencible yt good was intended (though not well expressed) and also sencible how malliciously it would be reflected on if it came to the hands of such as you are"; the book seeks to "sow discention among brethren...tearming Freinds 'the Foxoman sect' and 'Foxomans' and would make ym as bad or worse then ye papists"; they [Crisp et al] appear to be "men of perverse mindes and spirits because they run "to such a heighth of prejudice and enmitie where the difference is soe small, as yee acknowledge...your-selves, for yee confesse the difference is about the forme and power of womens meetings and having them meet apart from the men, when they have noe busines requires it, and the other thing yee object agst is about the forme of marriages...but doe not shew w[ha]t is ye forme yee object agst. As for the womens meetings, both in cities, townes and countries, it doth appear to be most convenient for them to meet in such a manner as may best answer the end of their meeting, and the end of their meeting being to take care of women, and as well in the countries as sities or townes, if men and women meet together and womens affaires present wch are not fir to be discoursed before men w[ha]t must they doe? Either let it alone or withdraw? And where soe much busines doth not present as in sities or great townes, may they not spend the time they have to spare to their mutuall comfort in waiting upon the Lord, and keeping their usuall times are alwaies ready to answer their service as it presents, and wheras none are compelled to come to the womens meetings agst their freedome, what injurie is done to any yt this should make soe great a difference?"; all of this "appears not only unchristian like, but irrationall yt soe small differences shouls produce soe great annimosities"; one can only conclude that "the spirit of Beliall hath entred you wch cannot endure the yoke of Christ, and this cryes out agst the order of the Gospel extablished in men and womens meeting as impositions wheras nothing is imposed on but yt wch bears not the yoke of Christ"; by abusing the Church of Christ they deprive it "of the power He hath given it" and what will become of them when "the Devill comes to be cast out"; they are only aiding the enimies of Truth who will now say, "Ha Ha ...the Quakers are divided"; they are wrong in thinking that an occasion has been given here, for there is "a great deale of difference between giving an occasion weakly or ignorantly for want of well wording a good intent, and doeing it wilfully and malliciously in enmitie and prejudice"; they have not only rejoiced "at any weaknes among God's people, but aggravate it in the highest nature yt may be...as if you thought you never could doe the Devill service enough"

For my dear Father George Fox and my Dear Friends George Whitehead and Alexander Parker,
this in London

Contents:
[The letter begins on the second side of number 49 and ends on the second side of number 48];
They are honourable in the Lord not only among those with whom they are outwardly present
“but even in the Ilands afarre of[f]”; Friends have lovingly accepted “your comfortable advice
and tender reprofe where things are amise [see number 46], the effects whereof hath been
manifested in your severall epistles to Freinds in this place [Barbados], one of wch I lately
rec[eive]d, being an answer to a paper given forth by ou[r] Quarterly Meeting [on the 23 rd of the
10 th month [December], 1680] to wch mine and my wive’s [Margaret nee Fell] names were and
some others [in all, 82 signatories], but nit with a full sonsent, for though we were very much
burdened in ourselves while many...did very much stand up for it, and judging yt diverse were
there...who subscribed to the paper who were farre from submitting to the judment of the spirit of
Truth either in themselves or others, for fear of hindering them from that submission yt might be
of generall benefit, I put my hand and my wife suffered her name to be put to the paper”;
although the intent of Friends was good, “the paper was very ill worded considering w[ha]t
hands it hath come unto, for the day before the Quarterly Meeting was, we got one if Thomas
Crispe’s [Crisp’s] booke[s] wherein the paper was printed [Babel’s Builders Unmasking
Themselves; see numbers 46-47] with your answer to it”, which though it might do hurt in some
other places, might in fact “moderate the spirits of some who otherwise might have been more
rigid. It [Fox’s answer] was read in the open Quarterly meeting and your judgm[en]t freely
submitted to and ordered yt the Quarterly meeting paper should be taken out of the booke and
your answer put in the place of it”; there were diverse there [at the Quarterly meeting] who did
not usually attend, but now did so “to hear your answer read and to vent themselves upon it, wch
they did after a large manner and very ill becoming such a metting. John Weale moved yt Friends
should give forth a letter of condemnation of it, wch should be spread among the world, for he
said it had dome more hurt then wither James Naylour [Nayler] or John Perrot,...and Oliver
Hooton had drawne up some reasons why he could not signe the paper, wch he had written soon
after going forth of the paper wch some Freinds were appointed to overlooke before it was
publickly read, and they finding that the reading of it would rather doe hurt then good and yt the
occation for wch it was written was over, desiring him to let it alone, wch he consenting to, did

very much abate the heat in severall. Though I was not well satisfied with the writing if the paper
nor in setting my hand to it, yet finding yt severall in a wrong spirit would seem to joyne with
you in judging the paper and yet would trample upon Freinds, wch forced me to keep the closer
to Freinds yt they might not be quite overborne and a paper of condemnation being urged, it was
asked whether you were not full in your answer, and if such thing had been needfull whether yee
would not have advised Freinds to it, and you not advising to such a thing, Freinds did not
yeild”; there are several who do not attend the Quarterly meeting or any other meeting except
“upon such occasions as this”; in fact “when your epistle with W[illia]m Gibson[‘s] and James
Parke’s was brought to a meeting for mixt people, there were some who had not been ... at such a
meeting for neer two years, and though I doe understand the blame of not reading the Epistle at
yt time was laid upon Ralph Fretwell and myselfe, yet there was such a dispute before we came
into the meeting yt I wondered what was the matter, not having heard Freinds so high since I
came last unto the country, and w[ha]t I did was by way of endeavouring to moderate, for after
much time was spent and Freinds understood yt Christopher Newham would have brought it to
the six weekes meeting a fortnight before, but was perswaded to the contrary wherin [it]
[ap]peared, though the letter was not directed to any meeting more yn [an]other, yet yt wch was
intended was, as there was something of re[proof] and caution, to make it as publick as might be,
wch I know was not intended by the writers, and because I said, upon reading 4 or 5 lines of the
begining, finding differences and controversies mentioned, yt I did not looke upon yt [the
meeting of mixed people] [as] a fit meeting to read it in, and my words were presently perverted
thus, yt I did not looke upon the letter [as] fir to be read in that meeting”; meant no such thing,
“but in regard there were diverse boyes and young raw and unsetled people, I did not looke upon
it soe fit an oooprtunitie of reading it”; it was however afterwards read twice at a six week’s
meeting “in the same place, where the women came to the men on purpose” and it was “very
well reveived”; in order that things might be well understood, “we got a meeting with severall
masters of the ships where things were mildly and cooly discoursed, and they seemed to be well
satisfied”; thus hoped to have heard no more of it but have heard that there “hath been a
complaining in England, as if the love of Freinds who writ yt letter [i.e. Fox, Parker and
Whitehead] had been very much slighted because it was not...read at that unseasonable time”;
understands this by two letters, or else would not have mentioned “one word of it, for I know
these things cannot be pleasant to you to hear”; at the last Six Week’s Meeting, John Weale “with
severall others were there” and words were exchanged between two Friends at which point John
Weale “brings out you Epistle and desired it might be read, wch though not altogether in season,
Freinds being then on otherbusines, wch tooke ym up a considerable time in debating, yet yt noe
offence might be taken and Freinds were desired to take good notice of the advice in it, it being
very wholesome and good, but in reading over the coppie yt John Weale brought, we found in
one place ‘aposles of the Lord’ instead of ‘a people of the Lord’ wch was a mistake Richard Ford
saw in a coppie of it wch some apostates had gotten, in wch also was a worse mistake, for
instead of ‘keep out all discord’, it was in theirs ‘keep out all concord’”; fears that several “of the
Apostates...doe endeavour to get soppies [of] all particular epistles, wch are of particular service”
and rejoice when there is anything of reproof to Friends in them, even when given with love and
tenderness; therefore, desires that “when there is occasion to send over any epistles, if you know
not of any fit here to send them to, that they may be [one word is torn out here] by such as are of

a right gospell spirit and not make a bad use of that w[ch] is intended for the generall good of
Friends”; there are also some [epistles] “wch both come over here and also give intelligence
fro[m] London of whatsoever is spoken though privately yt may reflect upon Fr[iends] in
generall or in any particular, wch very much gratifies those yt are...filled with prejudice already,
and John Weale in the Quarterly Meeting told Freinds yt a good Friend in England said the paper
was witchcraft, and Walter Benthall who went about a little to mend it said, he said yt it must
needs to have a spirit of witchcraft with it or else soe many simple people would not have been
bewitched to set their hands to it”; Thomas Parker “sent over Thomas Crispe’s [Crisp’s] booke to
his son in law who was a little before his going hence married to his [parker’s] daughter by a
preist (and he was...to give it to Edward Hunt who holds a correspondencie with the apostates
and by whose meanes it hath come to be dispersed as it hath been)”; would be glad if “this bitter
root of prejudice were quite rooted out from among us” because most of the time in meetings
“the passage of life is stopt, and Mary Weale, who sometimes speakes [a] few words in meetings,
will run out in prejudice, soe yt she is of[ten] times almost choaked”; one time, at a general
meeting “where many of the world were, after many good testimonies,...she stood up and said,
‘he yt dips his hand in the dish with me is the same yt shall betray me. Freinds, looke to it. You
are all oncerned’”; Richard Ford, by praying, atopped her, “wch John Weale tooke such offence
at yt privately asking me what I thought of Richard Ford’s soe doing, I said I feared if he had not
done soe, it might have been worse, wch John called the very quintessence of enmitie. Freinds
have used many endeavours to gaine John Weale and are willing to passe by and forget all that is
past and if anything atill rests yt cannot be buried and forgiven, to discourse it in coolnes. I have
much laboured with him diverse times...but as yet I doe not see yt anything doth prevaile”;
Friends desired to speak with his wife [Mary Weale?] and Thomas Clark and thus invited them
“to a meeting of Freinds in the ministry”; John Weale came along with them and there was much
moderate discourse, first with Thomas Clark who was persuaded “to refraine his frequent going
to Allice Lear, formerly Alice Butcher, who is in great opposition to Freinds, and Freinds fear his
going thither and not being soe wise as he should be is both a hurt to her and himselfe”; however
John Weale told Friends “yt a Friend told him yt he heard George Fox say yt he did well in
visiting her, wch if Freinds were sencible was for either of their good, they would not be agst, but
they have cause to fear the contrary, seeing they are very friendly and familier, and yet she hath
an utter enmitie agst all other Freinds and would not soe much as speake with ot see diverse
Freinds though they have gone many miles in the love of God to visit her”; acquaints them with
all this so that they can remedy the same “for we have found by experience...yt Epistles from you
who are Elders have been of great sevice here”; notes the “great deadnes and dulnes yt hath been
in our meetings in generall even when the best of Freinds amongst us have been gathered
together”; probably due to want of love and therefore “the only remedie wilbe a promoting of
love in generall”; thus, “it was upon me to propound...to the meeting of Freinds on the ministry
that differences and strifes may be wholy laid asid[e] and all yt had ought agst another might
forgive one another...wch at present is under the consideration of that meeting” and from them it
will go to the Quarterly and six week’s meetings “and from thence to the particular monthly
meetings, and from thence to the particular, even the apostates themselves”; those who reject it
will remain excluded; as to the meetings, “I thinke it necessarie to give you an acc[oun]t yt when
yee write any Epistles you may direct them to those meetings you would have them read at, and

then there wilbe noe controversie but you directions followed”; there are four Quarterly meetings
and are held at the houses of four Friends for three days, two of which are for meetings of
worship and the third is for business; unfortunately “we cannot yet bring them to there full
service, because divers intrude who are not fit to be at such meetings”; believes that it shouldbe
ordered “yt none should come to quarterly meetings but such as are wither chosen or well
apporved of by the particular meetings, but some Freinds, fearing it may give severall offence
have not yeilded to it” and therefore, much necessary business is waved and sometimes “weake
Freinds hear disputes wch are not for their benefit”; there are also between every Wuartetly
meeting, two general monthly meetings “at the Bridge Towne [Bridgetown], wch continues to
daies, the first day of wch...used to be for busines” and until they were altered were “great
meetings of contention” but now the men and women meet apart for “about two or three hours”
and if any general epistle should come relating to doctrine, it is read “and ordered how to be
dispersed among Freinds and a collection made”; then the men and women go into the public
meeting “and there have a meeting of worship”; marraiges are sometimes brought to the men and
womens meeting “after they have passes the particular meetings”; because little comes to that
meeting “wch may admit disputes, there are invited toit young convinced Freinds and Freinds
children who are growing towards yea[re] of discretion, and since meetings have been thus
altered, they have been very peacable though some who consented to the altering of them are not
now well pleased with ym”; on the morning of the second day of the general meeting. “Freinds
in the ministry meet for the supplying of the first daie’s meeting for a fortnight, and afterwards
there is a publick meeting for worship”; between the general and Quarterly meetings, “we have a
meeting on the 3d day of the weeke, where in the morning Freinds in the ministry meet and
where things are treated of in relation to the publick service of Truth, but soe many presse on us
yt often times we cannot speake to things necessarie”; after that meeting, “there is a publick
meeting for worship, where are most of Freinds in the ministry in the Iland [island]” bit with so
many coming a great way and with time being short, “we are streightened” and cannot get
through necessary things, and therefore they “were glad...of thy [George Fox] advice to have yt
meeting on the second day, wch we have not had time yet to settle”; there are also six week’s
meetings which answer the business of the six week’s meeting at London “and to these meetings
we would willingly have none come but established Freinds, such as are sound in their minds
and judgm[en]ts and fr[ee] from contention, though we cannot alwaies have it soe”; since there
are 6 divisions, “we have in every division a particular monthly meeting to ech all yt are
convinced and walke honestly doe come”, while on first days, “we have 5 or 6 publick meetings
the supply of which is taken care of at meetings of Friends in the ministry “wch doe soe fall in
turnes yt on[ce] in 5 weekes there is a publick meeting on first daies to wch any yt des[ire] may
come in any part of the Iland [island]”; for the further information of Friends, “I doe intend to
send my brother [William] Meade a plat of ye Iland with the severall division lines drawne in it
and an acc[oun]t of all ...meetings in the Iland, wch may be ready for Freinds information when
ever there is occasion”; hope they can give assistance “yt the unseemly practice of contention
wch...may well be tearmed a custome, may bee [en]ded from amongst us”

Thou hast beene made a messenger to mee to proclame glade tydeings to my weary soule, as sometimes I have heretofore specified unto ye"; however since last parting from her, "I have enjoyed ye unspeakeably, the manner I am not att present fre[e] to speake of"; the Lord has made her "His angell or messenger, this two tymes to publich [does he mean "publish"] peace unto mee"; at Jerrard [Gerrard] Robert's house on the 6th day of the 7th month [September] he received her letter "dated about the 17 day, 6 mon. [August]" which he welcomed; as for "what thou speakes of Samuel's [Fisher] goeing, it is as thou speakes, and thy exhortations to mee, they are to bee observed it's the same what the Light hath for some tyme past and nowe att present calls for. Hee [Samuel Fisher] will not lett it bee knowen unto mee yt hee sees any clearnes of goeing wth mee, but tells mee hee knowes not but something may bee upon him to ye Jewes in Amsterdam in Holland, and hee thinkes to have liberty to.goe over thyther, but it's like hee cannot conveniently goe till about that tyme they call Michaelmas, and from thence he knowes nothing but of returneing backe. He says hee beleeves there is service for him in England. I dare not but thinke well of him for the Seed's sake, but this I knowe, yt what I received was eternall, and soe I is to waite to submitt to [y]e will of the Mover... I have made litle speech of it to any though it hath beene propounded to mee by m[any?],... yt if hee should not goe, I hope the Truth shall not suffer in it"; was once free "to tell him in much feare yt if hee did not goe, hee would suffere losse and hee tells mee yt word stickes closse to him. His [Samuel Fisher's] wife his [is] weake in body and noe likelyhood of removeing. Thy books called 'The Second Call to the Seed of Izraell' [published as A Loving Salutation to the Seed of Abraham; Wing F634] was a while agoe finished and as hee [Samuel Fisher?] hath opportunity, hee goes one in Hebrew wth the first [the Hebrew edition of printed in 1660]. It's difficult. Alsoe thy Epistle it's finished. I have them both in latin. I entended to have them printed in one volume in Holland, to witt, the Hebrew coppie and the other two in Latin.

: Justes Flimen, Westmarland [Westmorland], this Filmon [Fleming] did presen one to death, 1663 [by George Fox]
: And Flinnen [Fleming] his wife [Barbara nee Fletcher] died and one of her children and shee laft [left] 14 montherles [motherless] children, a sad judgement upon an ould percuter [persecuter] [by George Fox]
Contents: Notes that "mercy and compassion and love and kindness adorns and graces men and Magistrates"; asks whether he has not heard "the cry of ye widdowes and ye cry of ye fatherless, who are made, through persecution?"; asks if they were not "driven like sheep from constable to constable, as though they had been the greatest transgressors or malefactors in ye land, which grieved and broke the hearts of many sober people to see how their innocent neighbours and their countrey men... should bee thus used and served"; another one is dead "whom thou sents to prison, having five children, both motherless and fatherless"; wonders how he [Fleming] could do otherwise "but take care of those fatherless infants, and also for ye other, for his wife and family"; see Job 29; compares Job and he and warns him that "ye day of God's eternall judgement will come... and every man must give an account and have a reward according to his deeds... And ag[ai]n Justice Fleeming, consider when John Stubbs was brought before y[o]u, having a wife [Elizabeth] and four smale children and little to live on,...which as soon as ever he appeared, thou cryed 'put the Oath [of Allegiance] to that man and when hee confessed hee was but a poor man, yet...y[o]u had no regard, but cast away pitty and not hearing what hee would say, and so now hee is kept up in prison because hee would not sweare"; queries whether he would have cast Christ and the Apostles into prison "if they had been in ye dayes which c[om]mands not to sweare at all"; also "can allegiance bee to ye King in going to that which Christ and ye Apostle saith is evill"; as for John Stubbs, now that he is kept in prison "thou wilt surely take order wth his family yt his children do not starve and see yt they do not want bread. And also W[illia]m Wilson, parish and neighbours which was industrious, known to all ye parish and neighbour and carefull to maintaine his wife and children and so had little but what hee gott by his hands in dilligence and travels to supply himself,...and how should his wife maintaine her children and thou cast her husband in prison and make him uncapable by tendering ye Oath to him and putting him in prison,...for the noyce of it is in ye very marketts, and ye death of thy two neighbours"; queries whether John Stubbs and [William Wilson] would not have their liberty if they has simply gone "to a Mountybank and a stage play or...to a hunting and sweare"; asks him to consider for "wee know ye King's mind is ty there should bee no cruelty inflicted upon his peaceable subjects"; several "poor, honest people were fined, who had more need to have given them something"; all of his neighbours know this as well as his country people that some were fined "lives upon the charity of other people"; what honour or grace can be gained by casting his neighbors into prison simply because "they cannot swear nor take an oath"; yet "have not many of y[o]u first sworn on[e] way and then another way, for people knowes ye Quakers principle yt it's year and nay, and they know they keep to their yea and their nay"; thus "wee leave it to ye spirit of God in y[o]ur consciences and to Justice Flemming who was so swift for takeing Georg[e] Fox and so grieved at them yt had not taken him"; warns him to "take heed of Herod's hard heartedness and casting away all pitty. Esau did so and not Jacob. Also Thomas Walters of Boutle [Bootle] is cast into prison and imposed the Oath upon him through thee, and for denying to sweare at all,...hee is continued in prison, who hath 5 smale children and his wife at down lying. Surely thou wilt take care for them also"; queries how he will answer at the day of Judgement having stained himself 'wth ye b[lood] of ye Innocent" when, in fact, he might have "done good" among his peaceable neighbours; "The King's [Charles II] favour and his mercy and clemency to sober people to tender consciences hath been largly manifested, wch thou hast abused in persecuting his peaceable subjects, for at Lonfdon and in other parts the Quaker's meettings are peaceable"; [the next two lines are damaged but in Ellwood's edition of Fox's Journal, p.280, it appears that the lines refer to Yorkshire where the plot had been an that Friends innocency there had been accepted by the Justices]; emphasizes that the law "was not made for ye righteous but for sinner and transgessors"; nonetheless, 'ye Quakers can say 'ye Lord forgive thee' and lay not these thinges to thy charge if it bee His will"; (Postscript- [there are 13 lines in cipher as well as the following] notes the case of W[illia]m Grave "to whom thou hast pretended much love and friendship, and whom thou hast cast into prison, and what thou would do for him, who came hither to ye service of ye countrey, and when he came hither, his service would not be taken, upon wch the Oath was tendred to him as a snare, and so was kept in prison untill ye Sessions, and when the Oath was tendred to him ag[ai]n then thou never open[e]d thy mouth as for his good, though thou knew him to bee thy neighbour and the cause of his first commitment,...and so thou maist remember what thou saidst to his wife, being a justice, both of Lancashire and Westmorland and Cumberland, so now thou maist see what is thy work on his behalfe, as knowing before hee could not swear") 
: This is printed, with some small differences and without the pistscript in Thomas Ellwood's edition of George Fox's Journal, I, 278-280
: The postscript has been printed [except for the cipher] in JFHS, VII (September, 1910), 146
Research Notes: Letter is signed by a L.M. but the endorsement "notes this as the work of George Fox and Fox in his Journal ascribes it to the prisoners at Lancaster." I've kept L.M. as the sender, but it is likely that L.M. refers to George Fox. Daniel Fleming has both the Justice and Sir titles, chose to encode Justice but can change to Sir if preferred. No explicit locations named.

I was once with my sister to speake with my brother [George] Fell, but he was not at home, and since I was there and carried thy letter to him, and then they said he was gone to Whitehall. We have not seen him now about a fortnight and soe know not what he hat[h] done, or how farre he hath proceeded [in gaining Margaret Fell's estate]"; have spoken with Thomas Speed "who was last weeke with him at Whitehall where he searched ye record where all such things, if they are given away, are entred, and T.S. told me they could not find yt it was then granted to any one. My sister [Mary Fell] told me my brother [George Fell] was with Coll[onel Richard] Kirkby and that he was very courteous to him, but it is well knowne what his fair words come to. I forgot in my last to give thee an acc[oun]t of what I had done about the £36 my brother was to pay Rob[er]t Dring"; details relating to that matter; "When I have an answer to my last to thee, I may write further to that bussines"; the past week, "I rec[eive]d a letter from P[eter?] Evans wherin was enclosed a very bad one to thee, wch I doe not judge worth paying postage for soe farre [probably from Barbados] nor worth troubling thee with, but this I perceive by his letter they were [a]ll much troubled at thine and he thinkes it may be much prejudice to me, for he thus writes, 'I desire thee by the next to write to thy father [Lieutenant- Colonel Thomas] and mother and excuse thyselfe in this matter for I perceive the thing may worke much to thy prejudice else and thy father will not signe the bond [John Rous had asked his father to settle £20,000 on him and if he died, on his wife and children; see Isabel Ross, Margaret Fell, mother of Quakerism, p.187], neither will there be need for thee to presse it either in relation to thy selfe or wife [Margaret nee Fell, junior], for I perceive his intentions are clear concerning thee (without such things as that letter should turne them)'. I am well satisfied concerning his intentions towards me while I live, but my desire is to get the bond signed yt if I should die, my wife nor children, if the Lord please to give me any, may not suffer, but I thinke it may be well to forbear urging it till their spirits are more downe, and in the meane time if my signing a bond my doe any good, I shalbe very willing and shall after a while...write to my father to signe that, but I perceive that ye greatnes of ye obligation being £20,000 is something stumbled at, soe yt if thou thinke fit, it be £10,000 or £12,000. wch it may be will not be so much looked at, I shall be willing to do what may be thought necessarie for me to doe, for I would not have anything wanting to secure to my wife yt wch is allready granted her, for I looke upon it she very well deserves it if it had been more. My wife rec[eive]d G.F.'s [George Fox's]...lines wch I forgot to mention in my last, being taken up soe much wth yt busines"; about 50 were taken "from ye Bull and Mouth [the Friends meeting house at Aldersgate] yesterday and about 18 from Mile End"; wife [Margaret] and siser [Mary Fell?] "are both well and remember their dear love to thee and G.F., as also doth Thomas Coveney, Elizabeth Trot [Trott], Marg[are]t Drinkell [Drinkwell] and Mary Strutt. There is great expectation of a war with the Dutch and many ships are a fitting for it"; (Postscript- "I had this day a letter from my brother [William] Yeamans and they were both well. Thy letter to my brother and sister [Isabel nee Fell] Yeamans I send by ye post last 7th day")

If we find he doth not nor cannot doe anything, we may get some given to ye King...at Whitehall. The meeting were generally all disturbed yesterday, but none fined or committed to prison yt I hear of. My father [George Fox] was at Ratcliffe [Ratcliff] in 1st day where Freinds were kept out.

The sessions is this weeke at Hickes’s [Hick’s] Hall where they have been endeavouring to indite [indict] ye 7 freinds in prison for a riot, but could not by law frame an indictmt agst [against] ym [them]. They make very great havock in severall parts of the country but Freinds are kept in the dominion of Truth over them. My father was well last night and my wife [Margaret née Fell, Junior] this morning who is gone to Betty Baylie’s [Bayly’s] marriage and meets me this night at Edward Brookes, his house”; love “to thee, my sisters and Freinds”; (Postscript- “Coll[onel Richard] Kerby [Kirkby] was last First Day at Horseliedowne [Horsleydown] and yt day weeke at ye Peele [Peel], but he finds not the Justices here soe forward as he used to be in the north”)

W[he]n I was in Jo[h]n Hull's place with thy husband. I was not behinde in writeing frequently, but now I judge it superfluous to write soe often in regard thou maist have a more perfect account from thy sonne Rouse of John Hull or both"; however, now feels it is his duty to write "to give thee an account of thinges here at present in this Island"; firstly, "thy husband is finely well and...pretty stronge and rides abroad to meetings from one side of ye Island to another, and hath been soe some weekes"; only giving a present account, since "the account...I sent to W[illia]m Dundas...was ordered to be sent to thee, wch I hope is comed to thy hands some weeks since"; about three weeks past 'thy husband went to visite ye Governour [Colonel Christopher Codrington, the Lt-Governor] att his owne house, and he was very civilly and kindly...treated of him.

There is ye finest ayre in ye Island about Lewis, his plantac[i]on. The next day after he went to Lewis Morrice's, Thomas Briggs and W[illia]m Edmondson went to him to take their leave of him, being to passe to Antegoe [Antiqua] and Mevia [Nevis] ye following day, wch was upon ye seaventh day of the week, just this day 2 weeks. They passed away from thy husband at yt place and Lewis is gone along with them. Soe here is at present thy husband and Solomon [Eccles] and I an upon first day meettings thy son Rouse helps us. Wm Bayliffe is here. The people in a manner generally affects him very much and it's well"; there are mighty great meetings in the island and "a very great convincement in all parts"; "Thy husband hath had severall meettings among ye men and women Friends to ye generall satisfaction of all Friends in ye Island. He hath had 2 great First day meettings at Thomas Rouse's, it being ye greatest meetting in ye Island except this generall meeting at ye Town aforementioned. Now tomorrow being ye First day, I think he will have a meeting at one Jo[h]n Holder's who is a Justice of Peace. Solomon and I have been there already at 2...meetings. The Truth is fre[e]ly preached both to white people and black people. Solomon and I have had severall meettings among ye Negroes in severall plantations and it's like must have more yet, but thy husband, it's like, hath had more then any of us. We feel the Lord's presence and power in that service as well as wn we speak among the white people,...and yt's enough. Thy husband had ye first meeting wth them, and then after a while it fell upon me and Sollomon and it was a great crosse at ye first, but now it's made more easy"; love "to thyselfe and children and Friends in thy house...and to...Leonard Fell and his wife [Mary], and R[obert] and W[illiam] Salthouse"

Wherefore, to prevent further mistakes and trouble, I would advise sister [Rachel Abram [Abraham] to putt it downe in a booke by way of acc[oun]t what was oweinge to sister Susan, and how p[ai]d her, as alsoe ye £122 oweinge to my father and then at any time when you have a minde to know, it is but lookeing into that booke, and you may know how ye acc[oun]t stands without ye trouble of lookeing out former letters wch mentions such acc[oun]ts and matters, wch shee may easily enter in a booke out of this letter now when it is fresh in her minde.

Yt for sister Lower is a featherbed ticke[?]...that shee sent to bro[ther John] Rous to buy for her.

Wee thought it longe yt wee heard not from him [Lower was at that time imprisoned in Launceston, having been praemunired], but I suppose the reason was ye letters were stopt, either by ye stormy weather or some other way. His businesse here [in London, where Friends were trying to secure his release] lies as it did, not p[er]fected The court has beene very busy of lare. Great wheeles moves slowly, but wee have good hopes to effect it in time.

Abstract: 36. A Pedigree of the Chetham family, written apparently by Joseph Foster and sent by him to "My dear Miss Abraham" [see below] in 1876. The Pedigree begins in the mid-sixteenth century and ends in the early nineteenth century. Included is the marriage of Mary, daughter of John Abraham to Edward Chetham of Chetham and Nuthurst, son of Edward Chetham of Chetham and Smedley, and Alice, daughter of Robert Wilson of Smedley. The marriage took place in 1683. It is noted also that Mary Abraham was buried on 27 Feb[ruary] 1706. The marriage apparently produced two children- Edward Chetham and Alice Chetham. [Mary Abraham, unlike her father, was not a Quaker,nor was her husband; see JFHS, XI (October, 1914), 173]. On the other side of the pedigree is in the following letter: Joseph Foster to "My dear Miss [Emma C. ?] Abraham"

Contents: While digging away "at my peerage, I have unearthed a Chetham pedigree, and as I think it will be of great interest to you, I have copied it over on the inside of this"; received it the previous day from the Frere family; W[illiam] Langton, of Manchester "is supposed to be editing the 'Visitation of Lancashire of 1532'. Those already published are 1567, 1613, and 1666. I do not think it is actually necessary that the drawings of the arms sh[oul]d be returned"; would be sufficient simply to "let me know the blazon of it"; believes that it was "'On a chevron between 3 etoiles as many towers'"; sends love to Mr Abraham and to "your Aunt, and if Henry is with you, please give him my love"

Therefore, as to a prety quantitye of the landes which lyeth near this towne [Ulverston] and is convenient for setting, a perticular whereof I have herewith sent [number 38?; see below], wee could desire that some of our relations might purchase it (and are willing they should have it at the same rate wee tooke it in or less, considering the 4 mills and houses in Ulverstone [Ulverston] wee had valued with ye land), which wee propose for ye reason afores[ai]d, and not because...wee cannot raise soe much money by ye saile thereof as wee tooke it in and values it at, for I think the value which wee doe here put upon it is above £100 less then formerly was payd and layd out for it, and then now it would give, and if any of our relations upon a tender consideration hereof and for keeping it in ye fammely doe think fit to purchase it and is mindfull to give mee a defeazance [defeasance] thereof, I am willing to oblige myself and heirs, if they be desirous at 5 or 7 years end to have their money layd upon it to repay it them"; are pretty well; John [Abraham, son of Daniel and Rachel] "is prety diligent at his booke and doth improve in his learning"; "The season here hath been and is very cold.

However [I] doe desire thee [to] accept thereof for the present, and to pay thereof to mother w[hat] she pleaseth and place ye rest to acc[oun]t and within a few wee[ks], I intend to return more.

Contents: Has not written of late, believing that brother [Daniel] Abraham "has acquaint[e]d you of his owne affaires, and what else hath been proper for your enformation"; also thought it would be better not to write "dureinge ye time of his abode here"; however "wee beinge under ye excercise of his buisiness, as wee are sensable yee are much more, being more imediately concerned in ye country, I tho[ugh]t convenient to give you a short account how things stand at ye present. Ye matter is not as yet brought before ye Debuty [Deputy] Remembrancer to be taxed [for more on the subject of this letter see JFHS, XI (October, 1914), 177], but depends, and he is still here, waiteinge upon that occasion, wee not thinkeinge it necessary he should depart, till it be fully setled and adjusted"; the chief cause of writing now "is to acquaint you that this eveni[n]g my brother [Thomas] Lower and I were with Sir Tho[mas] Raulinson [Rawlinson] to offerr him paym[en]t of ye last years rent, carryinge money to discharge it, but he would not receive it, sayinge it would disorder his acco[un]ts to take so small a part of it here, and that he would have it paid to his receiver in ye country, exclaimeing ag[ain]st brother Abraham for putting him to so great trouble and calling his title in question, which has not been done by any but himself. Wee told him his refusall was, as he thought, upon a conscientous acco[un]t and would have him put a favorable construction upon it, but he would by no meanes be persuaded but it was a dishonest designe in him to defeat him of his right [to collect fee farm rent], exclaimeinge ye more because he sayd ther[e] was £111 paid to him to discharge this rent, which is not questioned by any but himselfe, saying broth[e]r Lower paid it, so we thinke it will be safe for you to see it paid to his receiver. I thinke he sayd his name was Simpson of Flookburrough [Flookborough]. However let it be paid, least ye necglect of it should add a furth[e]r charge. He told us he did expect his receiver would in a few dayes give him an acco[u]nt that all his rents to ye time called Michaelmas last were paid, tho[ugh] he knew not by what hands it would be done. I mention this passage, doubtinge least some adversaries should do it, thereby to make a gaine to ymselves [themselves] by preyinge furth[e]r upon ye estate, which cannot be prevented but by a timely paym[en]t of ye rent. Wee have laboured much to bring my broth[e]r to an understandinge and satisfaction in ye matter, being satisfied it could not be tithes [Daniel Abraham felt that fee farm rent charge was a form of tithes] because ther[e] is tithes payed besydes this incumbrance out of ye estate, and I thinke he was convinct [convinced] of his errour and mistake before he tooke out ye contents of what is recorded in ye Dutchy [of Lancaster] Office, which declares it to be a fee farme rent, and ther[e]fore may without any further doubt or scruple be paid hereafter. Wee were not willinge to omitt this post, supposeing if ye rent be paid before this next quarter day, it may put a stopp to the[i]r proceedings, who seem very sharp and designeinge to make advantages out of ye ruines of other men's estates, especially where they have ye pretence of lawes on the[i]r sides, or for the[i]r justification. It has happened very strang[e]ly that this damage and loss should be sustained without a due enquiry into ye nature of ye claime, but seeinge what's past cannot be recalled, wee hope for ye future it may be avoided, and that ye excercise occasioned ther[e]by may not afflict you any more, nor those concerned for you here. As to ye purchassinge of it off, it does not seem probable at present, but if any thinge can be done hereaft[e]r, ye oppertunity will be taken notice of by bro[ther] Lower, who has been very painefull and diligent in this buisiness hitherto"; love from he [William Ingram] and wife [Susannah nee Fell] "to our d[ea]r mother [Margaret Fox formerly Fell],...to thyself and son [John Abraham], and love also from brother [Daniel] Abraham

Research Notes: The first page contains a letter sent by William Ingram to Rachel Abraham. It appears that she responded to his letter on the second page/back side and Horle assumes she sent it back to Ingram. 

This letter does not have a date. The calendar notes that this letter was likely sent before letter 39. I chose to put the year in brackets to denote uncertainty and leave the day/month blank.

Ye like in some measure has attended people hereaway, but ye distemper not so extreame"; understand that sister [Margaret] Rouse [Rous nee Fell] "took her journey from Pontefract some time since to give thee a vissitt, and sist[e]r [Mary] Lower [nee Fell] more lately went from hence in order thereunto. Wee hope they are both safely arrived, though wee heard not of sist[e]r Lower, since her acco[un]t from Lancaster, and of her being ther[e] last 4th day was a weeke, except my broth[e]r [Thomas Lower] had anything by yesterday's post, whom since I have not seen.

I was somewhat concerned to desire thee not to let in any trouble into thy minde about that matter, for I hope all will come out well at last, for I knowe in part ye great care and diligence they have used to have him preserved in a sence of Truth, and out of ye polutions of this world, which I and many more that knowe him, are satisfied he is cleare and clean from, but so it has happened that he beinge of an active minde, could not content himself without some buissiness and diversion, more then ye country life with his fath[e]r [William Meade] and mother [Sarah Meade nee Fell] did afford, so the[i]r care and great concerne was how to fitt him with what might be most su[i]teable to his condition and inclination, which they were endeavoringe about for a considerable time, but nothinge yt was su[i]table presentinge, they gave him a diversion into Holland, of which thou hast been enformed"; when he returned, "ye matter of buisiness and employm[en]t againe entred into his consideration and he could not be satisfied with any arguments to diswade him from it, nor could be perswaded to accept of a country life with his father and mother" which is what they aimed at and desired; finally it was left to him to choose what employment to take "and he chose to understand ye Law, which I do not see is intended as though he should be a practitioner in it or make a pecuniarie advantage of it (for ther's no need of that), but to advance him in ye knowledg[e] of that so necessary to be knowne and to divert him for a season out of ye way of other company, who seemed to waite for acquaintance with him, which would not have done him good, tho[ugh] proffesinge Truth, nor been to his advantage any way, as it's hoped this may"; all things considered, "ther[e] does not seem much more could have been done on ye parents parts, who I knowe he is as dear to as the apple of the[i]r eye, and they are dayly attendinge him for his good, haveing placed him in an appartm[en]t next to a kinsman (and counsellor) who hath ye character of a very sober and honest man, and I am satisfied from what I knowe of him, he would rather be help to him, then a hindrance upon any acco[un]t"; must be left to the Lord; has written this in order "that thou mayst be satisfied in my broth[e]r and sister's care in this buisiness, and yt accordinge to my sense, they have not done anything on the[i]r parts, that may be occasion of trouble, either to thee (who I knowe are greatly concerned for coussen Nathanael), nor any other that have true respect for him"; love from he [William Ingram] and wife [Susannah nee Fell]

And tho I have had the misfortune to marry so, yet I have got a verry honest man who never debarrs me of going to ye meetings of Friends as oft as I please, so that I want for nothing but ye conversation of a husband of my principles, which yet I must own is a great loss.

Dated: Warrington, 24th Aug[u]st 1775
Addressed: Mr. Tho. Abraham in Dockray, Penrith [in Cumberland]
Endorsed: 1775- Aug. 24...Walter Kerfoot to Wm Tho. Abraham in Dockray, Penrith. Respects an estate proposed to be sold by Tho. Abraham. Note, the measurement is 56 acres, 0 rods, 55 perches. The annual value £136.17.1 and he thinks it would sell for at least 28 years purchase and he considers T.A.'s interest in it to be £1,900 or therabouts [by Joseph Foster]
Contents: "I am favored with your's and above I send you a good bill for £15 in exchange for your note. I have got the estate valued and measured. Clark's farm is 48 acres, 3 R[ods], 31 p[erches] valued at £117, 5[s], 6[d] p[er] ann[um], and Massey's farm is 7 acres, 0 r[ods], 24 p[erches] valued at £14, 11[s], 7[d] [the total acreage and value of the two are given as well], at which rents I bilieve there wo[uld?] be no difficulty in having good tenants and I presume the estates estimate your interest therein at £1,900 or thereabouts, when the present tenants terms are out, if Mr [Richard] Marriot will agree to what I have before recommended and which he can have no material or reasonable objection to, unless it be to depreciate your share of the estates, which I cannot suppose he could attempt or wish for. I sho[ul]d think the estate may s ell as well for your interest the next year as being longer postponed, and therefore the sooner you see Mr Marriot to put the business upon a proper footing and probably the better it may be"

Endorsed: John Abraham [possibly by John Abraham, son of Thomas and Orpah]
Contents: "Yours of the 19th only reached me last evening, and in reply have to inform you I will have great pleasure in assisting your inquiries in every way in my power. I have many deeds in my possession relating to Swarthmoor Hall, most of them of old dates", but the oldest appears to be dated the 8th of July, 1691, which is "a large one and somewhat of a curiosity in it's way", and which is signed by the following- "Charles Fell, Mary Fell, Margaret Fox [formerly Fell], Hannah Fell [nee Cooke], James Graves, Isabella Graves [nee Fell], John Rous, Margaret [nee Fell, jr.] Rous, W[illia]m Morrice, Isabella [Isabel] Morrice [nee Fell], William Meade, Sarah Meade [nee Fell], Thomas Lower, Mary Lower [nee Fell], William Ingram, Susannah Ingram [nee Fell], Rachel Abraham [nee Fell], Thomas Cotton and Mary [Cotton?]. The deed is a conveyance from the parties to Daniel Abraham, who I expect married a daughter of Judge [Sir Thomas] Fell [the daughter was Rachel]. It recites that Charles Fell, Esq. of Swarthmoore [Swarthmoor], the grandfather of the said Charles Fell. The great Grandfather of Charles is described as George, having in possession Hawkswell, in the parish of Ulverston, but not stated to reside there, Margret Fox of Swarthmoore, widow, Grandmother of the said Charles and heretofore the wife of Thomas Fell, Hannah Fell [nee Cooke], widow, relict of the said George Fell and mother of the said Charles Fell, Isabella Graves, only daughter of the said George Fell, John Bows [corrected in another hand to 'Rous'], of Kingston upon Thames in county of Surry [Surrey], Merchant, Abraham Morrice of the county of Lincoln, Mercer, William Meade of Fann [corrected in another hand to 'Fen'] Church [Fenchurch] Street, city of London, Merchant, Thomas Lower of Marsh Grainge [Grange], co. of Lancaster, Gentleman, William Ingram, of the city of London aforasaid, Tallow Chandler, Daniel Abraham of Swarthmoore Hall, Gentl[e]m[an]. The above Gentlemen married Margaret, [junior], Isabella [Isabel], Sarah, Mary, Susannah and Rachel, the six surviving daughters of the said Thomas Fell. Thomas Cotton of Ulverstone [Ulverston], Yeoman was the surviving ex[ecu]t[o]r of the last will of Thomas Fell. In the year 1759, William Lindow, Esq. Merchant of Lancaster, became the purchaser. He left it to his sister Eleanor, the wife of Mr James Jackson, described as Merch[an]t and Hatter of Ulverston for life with an entailo upon her daughter Ann, the wife of Mr William Dickinson, surgeon, Workington, and her eldest son. My Mother died in 1823 when it became my property as such eldest son. All the deeds shew that the estate was formerly of considerable extent and comprised, amongst other premises, three Corn Mills, three Malt Kilns and several estates and manors in the neighbourhood of Ulverston. It's value may be in part known by the extent of mortgage which Sir William Wintworth [Wentworth?], Bart., of Button Hall, co. York[shire] had upon it, £6,000. The Deed is dated, 24 Dec[em]b[e]r 1743. To all the signatures to the Deed of July 1691 Seals are attached, which appear to belong to different families. It is probable from what I have stated above that the family of Judge Fell had property in the district before his day. I have never seen his will and cannot discover in the hasty search made wheather Swarthmoore Hall had an estate of inheritance or otherwise. It is in some of the Deeds spell[ed] 'Swartymoore' or 'Swarthmoor Hall' and in some their is the final 'e'. If you think I can give any further information, I will again search or show any of my papers to any friend you wish, or should you or any one for you wish to examine the old house, I will give directions to the farmer to show you through it. All the old mouldings and ornamental parts have always been reported to Judge Fell. Many well carved pieces of pannelling and other things have been stolen from the place since I first knew it,...upwards of 50 years. I have heard that Mr [Robert] Abraham, who now edits a newspaper in Liverpool (The Journal), and who I expect is a descendant of the family [he was the son of Thomas Abraham, of Seaton, and Orpah Clarke; see Joseph Foster, The Pedigree of the Forsters of Cold Hesledon (1862), p. 21] who once owned the estate, has several papers relating to it and the family. As he lived in Whitehaven some time, I can read[i]ly obtain his address should you wish it"

Dated: Workington, Sept[ember] 16, 1842
Addressed: W. Benson, Esq., Manchester
Endorsed: John Abraham [possibly by John Abraham, son of Thomas and Orpah]
Contents: "I have had a short extract made from the Deed of 1691 [see number 62] which places beyond dispute that Judge [Sir Thomas] Fell's father was called George, and that the estate called Hawswell, otherwise Hawkswell had been in the family four generations. The deed is very long, covering 7 large skins of parchment and not being much accustomed to extract from such papers I find some difficulty in furnishing all you wish for. I expect it was Judge Fell that had the manors, but it is not stated how he became possessed of tnem. His property must have been large. The Deed recites the names and amount of rents of all the tenants-at-will and customary tenants of the Manor, or Lordship of Ulverstone [Ulverston], Blowith [Blawith], Nibthwait [Nibthwaite], etc. etc., and after, it sums up the property to be surrendered as situated in the parishes, townships, villages and places, of Ulverston, Swarthmoor, Dragleybeck, Hawkswell, Blowith, Lowith [Lowick], Pennington, Unwick [Urswick], Dalton, Coulton [Colton], Hawkshead, Nibthwait [Nibthwaite],a place name illegibled [a different hand has written above in pencil the place name 'Bethecar'?], Furness and Furness Fell [for more on these areas, see J.D. Marshall. Furness and the Industrial Revolution (1958)]. Some of the property is stated to consist of water, corn mills, windmills, iron furnaces, Forges, fisheries, customary rents, etc. etc. I again repeat, that I will with pleasure, give any other information in my power, as my papers only go back to 1691"; believes that Mr Abraham's family "will gave some of much older date"

Contents: "Mr. Perry called at my house some time ago when I was from home. I afterwards saw him in Cockermouth when he informed me of the purport of his visit and promised to call again the first time he was over. I have not since seen him. I will therefore do the best I can to answer some of your queries and hope when Mr Perry sees the papers he will be able to give all the information you require. The deed of 8th of July 1691 [see numbers 62 and 63] is one of sale to Mr Dan[ie]l Abraham, consideration £4,500, of which £3,900 was to be paid cash to J[ohn] Rouse [Rous], Ab[raha]m Morrice, William Meade, Thomas Lower, William Ingram...The Seal, I expect, the same as you sent. I have, however (being little versed in Heraldry) enclosed some rubbings of two Seals, one Rachill [Rachel] Abraham [nee Fell], the other Marg[are]t Fox's [formerly Fell], who it appears on the Deed has used the same. The other two are from the Fells. I have endeavoured also to take an impression in wax from both, which I send you. The estate I possess is tithe free, but it is only a small portion of what it formerly was. I have something more than 100 acres. As the estate was mortgaged to Sir W[illiam] Wentworth in 1743 it must have increased in value. The [blank] of latest date from your family I have are from John Abraham, the last, a copy of fine [for conveyances by fine, see A.W.B. Simpson, An Introduction to the History of the Land Law (1961), pp/ 115-117] from him and his wife [Sarah nee Foster] to Maude and Dodgson dated 31st Aug[us]t 1736. I have not had time to lookover the Deeds, therefore cannot say what was the extent in 1747. The estate came to me by entail. Mr [William] Lindow [see number 62] left it and other property to his sister Eleanor, the wife of Mr Ja[me]s Jackson (my Grandmother). My mother was an only child and from her it came to me as eldest son. I have given you a short abstract of the Deeds I possess and if you think I can furnish you with any other information I will be glad to give it"; [there follows a list of legal papers in the possession of W.L. Dickinson]- "1691, July 8th- Conveyance to Dan[ie]l Abraham; 1691, Oct[ober] 1st- [Charles] Fell and Tomlinsons to [William] Ingram in trust for Dan[ie]l Abraham; 1721q, Feb[ruary] 2nd- Deed for fine- Abraham to Forster; 1736, Jan[uary] 25th- Mr Abraham to Mr Forster, Mortgage £4,360; 1736, July 24th- Mr Abraham and Mr Forster to Maude and Dodgson; 1736, Aug[ust] 31st- Copy of fine, Abraham and wife to Maude and Dodgson; 1736, Nov[ember] - Mr Forster's will?

Abstract: 24-26. [These three letters are identical. The original appears to be 3/25 while the other two are exact copies as far as the text and two of the endorsements are concerned, see below] 
dated: 1652 [endorsed]
addressed: To G.F., Swarthmore [on all three of the letters]
endorsed: M.F. to G.F., 1652 and her children [this has been altered in a different hand to read, "M.F. and her children to G.F., 1652, 3"; this alteration appears in all three letters]
: This was sent to G.F. and he came back againe to thes that sent for him, and he that shakd the dost [dust] of his feet against was not long after convinced, 1652 [the word "against" is in a different hand and may have been added at a later date; this endorsement occurs in all three letters]
: This letter appears to have been written a few months after the convincement of Margt Fell and her children through the instrumentality of Geo. Fox, whose labours appear from his journal, to have been signally accompanied by Divine power about that time. It bears evident proofs of its having been the product of a state of spiritual childhood- of those whose sight has been dazzled by the luster of the instrument; to which they have applied appellations only due to the source from which it derived its efficacy. Geo. Fox was very careful to gather the people to Christ and there to leave them [signed "G.R"; the name "George Richardson" is pencilled in, by a different hand, beneath the intials; this endorsement occurs in the original letter only i.e. 3/25
contents: "The body of the letter heaps enormous praise upon G.F. for his guiding them to Christ; pleads for Fox's return "for in thee alone is our life and peace, and without thee have we no peace, for our soulls is much refreshed by seeing thee, and our lifes is preserved"; (lengthy postscript from M.F. [Margaret Fell, senior] acknowledging that "though thou hast shaked the dust of thy feet at him who would not receive thee, nor is not worthy of thee", they have received him [Fox] into their hearts; she reinforces the appeal for his return to them, "if it be but for two or three dayes to strike downe the deceite in him for the Truthe's sake"); [there are also brief one-line comments to Fox from Sarah, Susan, Isabel, and Mary Fell]"

Abstract: 56. M.F. [Margaret Fell] to A.P. [Alexander Parker] and W.G. [apparently this latter part of the salutation is incorrect; she apparently meant "G.W." since it is endorsed by George Fox, "G. Whighed" i.e. George Whitehead; see below]
dated: Lond[on], the 24 of the 5th mo. [July], [16]60
endorsed: M.F. to A. Parker and G. Whighed, 1660, read over, G.F. in Lankester [Lancaster], prsener [prisoner], 31 [appears to be George Fox's hand]
contents: "Although she has not written because of her service there and her heavy burdens and travels, she has not been unmindful of them and their sufferings; they are doing the service of the Lord and He will deliver them in His own time; she has laboured for five to six weeks with the great ones in power to inform them of Friend's sufferings "and the King [Charles II] hath promised much often and severall times he hath said it should bee helped and hee would looke to it, and that wee should not be abussed nor suffer for our religion"; however, she notes the difficulty of getting Friends released once they are cast into prison; the King is not suffered by "wicked bloody minded men"; thus, he once gave order to bring G.F. [George Fox] from Lancaster to be tried at London "but [General George] Monke [Monck] and ye rest that were about him would not suffer it, soe now he hath nothing to say when I goe to him but that will be give the judges orders that they shall hear Friendes and set them free, but what they will doe the Lord only knowes"; was with the King last seventh day but those around him answered and they appeared fearful the King should say anything of his own mind and they want him to act against his words concerning liberty of conscience; Friends and the Truth there are well, meetings quiet and full; at present she is stuck in London and foresees no time of her return; likely to be a time of trial for many not prepared for suffering; Colonel [Francis] Hacker, who with many more are in the Tower, is like to suffer deeply; John Swinton was apprehended the previous sixth day but she feels he will patiently endure what they will do against him"

contents: Hopes he will continue in long and happy days, as the Lord now smiles again on him by restoring him to power; he must remember that it is by God that "Kings rule and Princes decree justice"; God has set him "over many sortes of people of severall opinions as concerning ye worship of God" and it is up to him [Charles II] to "lett them every one enjoy ye liberty of their owne consciences"; he must commit his cause to God and rule as Solomon; he must forgive his enemies [the Regicides] and love them, for that is Christ's doctrine and command; it is for God to revenge and not for man; she exhorts him again to grant liberty of conscience and to "suppresse wickednes, oathes and drunkennes, lightnes and vanityes"; among the vain things to be dealt with are bonfires, maypoles, ballad singing and stage plays; by allowing these, he has caused many hearts to be set against his government , which result in plots against it; his Proclamation against drinking healths, and other debaucheries was a step in the right direction

dated: [The inclusion of Henry, Duke of Gloucester places this letter sometime between May-September, 1660 i.e. the Restoration of Charles II and the death of Henry, Duke of Gloucester; in Works, pg. 17, the date is put at the 4th month [June], 1660]

contents: [it appears that this letter, which resembles 3/99 although shorter, proved unsatisfactory and was used as a framework for 3/99 which probably was delivered instead of this one]; Love of God is toward them at present "and will be as you love and honnour Him, and rule, governe and order for Him"; God has restored them, not man; they must give relief to the suffering people of the Lord; [The second side of this letter is in a different hand, possibly that of Margaret herself, and bears no relation to the first side- it is her statement that Henry Porter, Mayor of Lancaster, sent four Constables to her house with a search warrant; they apprehended a man there [George Fox] who had broken no law; he was brought to Porter; bail was offered for his appearence to hear what would be laid to his charge, but Porter refused to accept it; the detainee was put in prison and kept close; was denied a copy of his Mittimus [warrant of committal], but only allowed to have it read over; all charges in it are false; she desires the governors of the nation to look into the matter; if he is guilty, so is she

contents: Notes sufferings of Quakers in New England since the King's letter against corporal punishment; in Boston, a man with a wife and five children was put in the stock and whipped and Friends were fined for praying and speaking at their meetings; Anne Coleman was banished; Nicholas Upshall was confined to prison for as long as he should live; another man was made senseless by their brutality; the Boston authorities claim that they forged the King's letter; have received letters about the cruel usage from Friends in New England; some in London went to Broadstreet, a New England magistrate, with the letters; he claims that John Leveret, their agent, was informed that the King simply wanted the magistrates not to inflict the death penalty, that the King did not rebuke them for putting Quakers to death and that the King intended sharp laws against them in England; she notes Captain Oliver claimed they would persecute Friends despite the King's letter; Broadstreet implied that Friends were less sober in New England than in England; three London Friends suffered at New England- one was condemned to die; the other two had one of their ears cut; Elizabeth Hooten, at Boston two nights "could not get a bed to lie in under 20 shillings a night (they having made a law yt whosoever entertaines a Quaker should pay 20 shillings)"; she finally proferred money to buy a house and land, the former to aid strangers, the latter to bury the dead;  they lay those things before them [King Charles II and Council] for their consideration; notes also the words of Major Denison regarding "the changing of ye government of England"; the jailer at Boston told a Friend of the report that the King intended to send a new Governor and that "they intended if he did, to stand upon their guard and oppose his coming by force of armes"; all those things condemn the King's authority; several Friends have come over to testify

dated: Swarthmore, ye 18 of 8 m. [October], 1679
contents: [This is meant to be an introduction to some letters and answers to priests and professors; this document itself discusses the origins of the Fells' involvement with Quakerism]; Had not heard of the Quakers until George Fox came and spoke of the Light of Christ in their conscience and of many other things; she heard him speak those things at Ulverston steeplehouse where they had gone to hear a sermon of priest [William] Lampitt; she sat in her pew and wept while Lampitt preached "for I saw yt all yt we had before was nothing worth"; Lampitt had allowed Fox to speak, thinking the latter would be in agreement with him; seeing otherwise, he sent for the Churchwardens to hail Fox out, but they allowed him to continue; finally, Justice John Sawrah [Sawrey] had him hailed out; many besides her were convinced and the Truth grew and increased; many went to the Steeplehouse to cry against the priests; the professors and priests thought it the work of the devil and called them witches and sorcerers and treated them accordingly; they could not persecute those at her house at Swarthmore since her husband [Judge Thomas Fell] was chief magistrate in the county; all the ministers were outside the doctrine of Christ; they ressembled those who had opposed Christ when he was upon the earth; the priests, alarmed at a powerful attack on their false foundations, petitioned Parliament and the two Crumwells [Oliver and Richard Cromwell] against the Quakers and began to write against them; "I was but younge in ye Truth yet I had a perfect and a pure testimony of God in my heart for God and His Truth"; she answered their charges and few of them ever answered again; all of that occurred some 26 or 27 years past; [their follows several biblical references and passages which apparently were used against the priests and professors by the Quakers- they include Psalm 58, Psalm 140, Isaiah 27, Matthew 23, Mark 12, Mark 3:29, John 6:70, The Acts 13:10, John 8:44, 1 John 3:8, Romans 13:2, Mark 16:16, Romans 14:3 [this was a mistake; the passage refers to Romans 14:23], 2 Thessalonians 2:12, 2 Thessalonians 1:8]

contents: She notes Judge [Sir Hugh] Windham's comment in his charge [to the jury] that the Quaker principle of the Light in every one would lead into all manner of sin; she disputes this, noting the Light is "ye condemnation of all sin"; "Oh, yt ever such should be sett up to be a judge who utters forth such blasphemy"; read John 1:9 relating to the Light; the Light shall witness against Judge Windham "who should be a judge upon ye evil [but] art found to be a judge upon ye good"; analysis of the doctrine of the Light; read John 3; she notes Windham's remarks were made in the case involving Cuthbert Hunter, tried for adultery and fornication for marrying without priests, but rather "according to ye man[n]our as he found in Scripture"; Windham claimed also that "it is contrary to ye Law of God and contrary to ye Law of man"; she asserts the falseness of that statement and that Hunter married in the Light and it was witnessed by those in the Light; she does admit that Hunter did not enter the Truth until half a year after his marriage but nonetheless he "did take his wife after ye example of ye Saints in Scripture"; all marriages not of the Light must be condemned

[George Fox] had been committed prisoner by Henry Porter three years previous; was tried at King's Bench and cleared by the King's judges and set free by the King's [Charles II] order; she acquaints them that Fox is at her house as a sojourner; they have come through the counties; all was quiet till they came to Yorkeshire, Dishoprick [Durham], and Westmerland [Westmorland] where rumors of a plot [Kaber Rigg Plot]; they know nothing about it and deny and abhor all plotting; writes to prevent any false accusations; [The second letter- this is to the judges [of assize]; Notes that she and George Fox have lain in wet, unfit prisons, the one [Fox] for seven months and the other [Fell] for six; the previous assize, they entered their traverse [to contest the indictment]; since then, Fox is not allowed out of the liberty of the castle [Lancaster] without a keeper; she is not allowed to go home to see her family; she considers that unjust as they had entered their traverses to their indictment; their accusers have no case; were taken neither at a meeting nor on a meeting day; both were taken at her home; were tendered the Oath [of Allegiance]; she had been taken by order from Cornell [Colonel Richard] Kirbie [Kirkby] to his brother [Justice William Kirkby] and to his cousin [Daniel] Fleming; while she is in prison, they continually disturb her children and family by hurrying them to sessions and threatening to imprison them; the innocent suffer while many breakers of the law go unpunished; she acquaints the judges that William Kirbie acted contrary to law against several of his neighbours who were indicted and fined upon the old Act against Conventicles and who were to appear the next Quarter Sessions but were taken again and ten of them were imprisoned; were put in a room with neither beds nor straw; are committed for two months and fined again; Kirbie threatens to take the fine although they are imprisoned; those acts are contrary to law; she asks the judges to do something about the sufferings "for if you doe not, when you are gone they will say, as they have done formerly, you ordered them to doe what you ["you" is crossed out] they doe"; her estate is only that of a widow and she has four daughters; she suffers only for her conscience and for the Lord

contents: He must love God and also love his neighbors; the previous time he was in the country he showed love to her and her family and when George Fox "came to thee, thou said thou had nothing against him and said if he staid at this house none should medell wth him"; yet, at sessions before that, she heard that he [Kirkby], when about to indict Rog[er] Sora [Sawrey] noted he should also have her [Margaret Fell]; several Friends were then fined and had their goods distrained triple the value; since then his brother [William Kirkby] came to their meeting and caused several poor men to be fined varying amounts; she notes the cause of that action was a letter sent by him [Colonel Kirkby] to the Bench at sessions; reproves him for getting others to do what he feared doing when in the area; she also denounces his brother for witnessing against them and for telling her it was only the beginning; she notes one of the justices told her that her house would not have been meddled with but for him [Colonel Kirkby]; "I see and find that a profesed enemey is a better friend then a profesed friend and a secrit enemey"; again reproves him for those actions but the Lord will take account of it and will plead their cause

: [The following is appended to the bottom of the letter, probably by Margaret Fell- "This aforesd pap[er] was writte to Jo[hn] Sawrey called a justice, a great p[er]secutor, one of ye first in ye north that set ye rude multitude to beat Friends, who set many in ye stocks and put in prison and M.F. was moved to goe to ye Steplehouse to speak to ye priest of ye p[ar]ish, where she and he lived and when she was in ye Steeplehouse, he came to her and said, "Good Ms Fell, goe into your own pew or else goe your way", and he took her by ye arme and offered to pull her away, but she said, "Hold thy hands off me", and she spoak to ye priest wt [what] she had to speak, and afterward she spoak to him and she charge[d] him to doe justice and not to wrong nor oppress ye poor people, wherupon he was vexed and writ a letter to her and sent it to her husband and charged her to prove what injustices he had done. So this letter is an answ[er] to his, and within a few years after [he] was drowned in a little ["little" is crossed out] water upon the rode co[m]ing from York [torn slightly; this endorsement is fully transcribed in Ross, p. 40]
contents: Lengthy appeal to him to repent and turn to the Lord or like a caterpillar, "bee swept out of ye way"; his "filthie high pharisaicall nature" keeps down God within him and he must let the latter rise up and "keepe downe the lustfull, jearinge, heardened nature wch is in thee"; notes his letter to her, though it came to her husband first; was full of lies; she denies his charges that she lied or that she was puffed up with malice and pride; she calls him a hypocrite; asks him to leave his "alehouse haunteinge" and his "tendringe of oathes to pore, ignorant people"; Jesus had commanded not to swear; she cites instances where he has done injustice- the case involving Dodgson "of the lawecoate" and Arthur Longe, the warrant granted to Richard Waller of Cartmell but his [Sawrey] refusal to prosecute the man who had been bound over, his actions against Richard Waller and family; she notes those are but three instances and "multitudes might bee added"; her husband [Judge Thomas Fell] would never do injustices such as instanced above; she accuses him of forcing poor people to buy him drinks at the alehouse day after day; he speaks of grace yet does not keep at home; "thou art ye woman yt goes abbroade and dost not abbide in thy owne house"; he should remember the parable of that woman, but "thou art ignorant of the parables"; despite his accusations against her, "if ever thou wittnesse the Truthe, thou wilt wittnesse mee"; his God is of the world and "thou shalt know to ye destroyeinge of thee and thy God, what God wee serve" [three sides]

contents: Although having said "my letter was welcome to thee, that in thy conscience will tell thee thou lyes"; [it appears that Margaret is writing the letter as if John Clayton was the author of it]; speaks to his conscience "but thee I deny"; he has called them [Quakers] deluded people and expressed sorrow because he [Clayton] has gone with them; "Let thy sorrow turne backe for thy selfe"; he [Clayton] has discovered the true, living God which is "the unknowne God to thee"; by saying "that some of them [Quakers] will be saved, though by fire...thou makes it manifest that thou speakes evill of that thou knowes not"; he will be condemned by the eternal spirit, as will all who think as he does; he is a hypocrite and a dissembler; "thou art for condemnacon and distruction by the fire"; it is he who is deluded "who blasphemes God and His temple"; what he knows of Christ was simply what he read in his [Clayton] letter "but Chr[ist] Jesus wthin thee thou art ignorant of"; he is an enemy to "them that deny ungodlynesse"; "if thou harken to that in thy conscience it will condemne thee with mee, for that I have unitie with, but thee I deny"; his defence of the ministers of England shows his ignorance for they do not teach the living God and are Antichrist; Jesus will destroy him; he must repent and turn to the Light in his conscience and obey it; "Jesus XT is rissen and revealed and made manifest in these whom thou and thy gospell ministers calls deluded people"; he must also beware of how he speaks of the Scriptures "for they are anothers and are not thine" [2 1/2 sides closely written; it is signed by "M.F." but a postscript is added, signed by "John Clayton"- "Writen from ye moving of ye spirit of ye Lord in one of them whome thou cales deluded, in love to thy soull. This is ye word of ye Lord to thee Jefray Elatson. Do not thou cale this railling, for if thou doast, in soe doing thou heaped coales of fier upon thy oune head"]

: To Jeffrey Ellettson [possibly by George Fox], 1654 one of ye same p[ro]fession wth mee whom I loved dearly [probably by Margaret Fell]
contents: She speaks to the Light of Jesus within him; she asserts that God spoke forth the Scriptures "soe if thou doe not know that wch gave forth the Scripture, how canst thou know yt God which was in them which gave it forth?"; he must examine God in his conscience to see what he possesses of the living God; by analogy, she asks him if he could live simply on the writings and covenants of an inheritance but not the things they spoke of; yet he professes the words of the living God but "without the substance and the life that spoke it"; turn to the Light and it will show "that thou art yet in Egipt and utter darknes"; he does not know Moses who was sent "to bringe the seed out of the house of darknes and bondage"; she reminds him that once she was in that profession more than he, even though he had left the country in search of more knowledge of God; yet, she found the true God and "that which was a barren wildernes is become a fruitfull hill"; warns him against making an image or likeness of Truth "for God forbidds all images and liknesses, in heaven above or in earth beneath"; he must repent, for he is blind and ignorant of God; "if ever thou know the true and livinge God, thou must owne us"

contents: She fears he goes against his conscience because he denies the Light in it "wch checkes yu when you act contrary to it"; she is moved to warn him once more to look to the Light; "Thou p[ro]fesseth a God and a Chr[ist] in words...but in workes denyes all" by denying the Light of Christ; she elaborates on her thesis regarding the Light and the Truth by brief comments on the Pharisees, the Gentiles and the Apostles; regarding the latter, for example, she notes "the Apostles walked by the manifestation of Truth commendinge themselves to every mans' conscience in the sight of God"; read Hebrews 9-10; concludes by noting she has love for his soul and he must take heed of this warning

: [In the middle of the second side, there is an address apparently unrelated to this letter- "For Margorat Fell at Swarthmor in Low Furnes, this with care"; although it appears directly in the middle of the text on that side, it does not interrupt the text in any way, which is unusual; perhaps Margaret wrote the letter on paper used previously and simply wrote around the address]
contents: Writes in tender love for his soul; reminds him of his former love and zeal for God and how he went seeking for Him, but now that God calls, he seems to want to run away "because yt His name and Truth goeth under reporache (as it ever did)"; turn to God "yt Hee may purge your ["your" is crossed out] thy conscience from dead works"; "will you not come unto Him that thou may have life?"; however, as long as he walks contrary to that in his conscience he is "under judgement and condemnation", not can he ever evade the Judge; she notes this is the third time she has written him "in obeydience to the moving of the spirit of the Lord"

Abstract: 160. dated: 1656
endorsed: This was given forth after a dispute at Manchester with Independents, Baptists and [Fifth] Monarchy Men about 1656; is on that profess[ion] [at the top of the document; there follows what appears to be a signature- perhaps M.F. [Margaret Fell]- the endorsement appears to be in her handwriting]
:1656, 19 [in the margin on the second side; this is followed by what may be a name, but is indiscipherable]
contents: [It appears that part of this document is missing, as it begins in the middle of a sentence]; She/He warns the Presbyterians, Independents and other sects that "yu are confused and divided in your vaine thoughts and imaginations"; Scriptures prove they are the Anti-Christs "which John speakes of which shall be in the last tymes"; read 1 John 2:18 and 1 John 4:2-3; she/he notes that those sects look for Christ to come and they mock the Quakers when they ask "what will yu Quakers doe who saith Christ [is] within yu, when Christ comes in the clouds?"; she/he warns that those who ask such a question forget the Apostle [John; see above] "who said every spirit who doth not confesse Him come in the flesh is not of God"; some of them utterly deny the Scriptures- like William Barret who denied 1 Peter 1:9 and Richard Herrick, who denied at Manchester "that Christ's body is spirituall"; she/he warns the poeple of Manchester to consider what they are being led into by such men who do not know the body of Christ; it is a case of the blind leading the blind; they emphasize Scripture rather than the Light "and soe betrayes poore people, and keepes their soules in death"; those who desire to know the living God and the Lord's body must turn to the Light; "Search into the Scriptures and yu will see them, the deceivers of your soules...for nothing...in that which they call their worshipp is accordinge to the Scriptures; while at variance among themselves, [Major John] Wiggin [Wigan], [Samuel] Eaton, Herricke [Herrick], Barret and [Richard] Hollingsworth [Hollingworth] "agree together in opposinge and p[er]secutinge the Truth"; the meeting, appointed by them, had been in an uproar; again warns the people to turn towards the Light "which is the world's condemnation, for the Light is the condemnation of the world and all the Antichrists that are in the world"

Abstract: dated: Kingston, ye 21 of ye 1st month [March], 1678 [There is doubt about this date; a letter has been inserted into the MSS from Isabel Ross to "My dear Muriel", dated 21 February 1946, which gives several reasons for her belief that the correct date is March 1673/4; she feels Margaret Rous simply wrote the wrong date; the letter does, in fact, indicate the latter date to be correct]
addressed:
endorsed: [On the addressed portion, someone has written a list of vegetables as if for a recipe or shopping list]
contents: All are well; however, "I have been since my goeing abroad after my lying in very much troubled wth a violent paine in my head"; much better the past two or three weeks; Tom [apparently their son, Thomas Rous, born 12 November 1673, died 26 April 1674] had been very ill but has recovered; rest of the children are well; very cold weather there; wheat, barley, mutton and beef are very scarce and dear and likely to get worst; father [George Fox] must go to Worchester [for trial]; [The next section is difficult to transcribe accurately due to Margaret's indiscriminate use of the pronouns "he" and "him", which cause confusion as to when she is speaking of Thomas Lower or of George Fox; an effort is made here to transcrible it intuitively and by utilising other available information; however, the reader is wise to carefully examine the document and not to rely on this listing]; she went to London "yt week bro[ther Thomas] Lower went and got him [G.F.] to Kingston"; he [G.F.] stayed three nights and then T. Ridger's brother came "and posted him in all hast away"; scarcely had time to speak to him, "it was unsertaine whether he went or not [to Worcester]"; many Friends "were imployed in speaking to judges and shrief [sheriff], King [Charles II] and Counsell to procure his stay but it seemes hee must goe ye [they] say next weeke"; the judges had granted a warrant; Friends had hoped things would fall out differently then brother Lower represented; he [G.F.] had feared they would hurry him down "hot being able to indue it"; love to her, to Leo[nard] and Mary Fell, to Jo[seph] and Jane Nicolson and to Friends; "Betty Walker is well and remembers her duty to her fa[ther] and mo[ther]" [part of this letter damaged]
