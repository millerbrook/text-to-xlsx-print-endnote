Abstract: 24-26. [These three letters are identical. The original appears to be 3/25 while the other two are exact copies as far as the text and two of the endorsements are concerned, see below] 
dated: 1652 [endorsed]
addressed: To G.F., Swarthmore [on all three of the letters]
endorsed: M.F. to G.F., 1652 and her children [this has been altered in a different hand to read, "M.F. and her children to G.F., 1652, 3"; this alteration appears in all three letters]
: This was sent to G.F. and he came back againe to thes that sent for him, and he that shakd the dost [dust] of his feet against was not long after convinced, 1652 [the word "against" is in a different hand and may have been added at a later date; this endorsement occurs in all three letters]
: This letter appears to have been written a few months after the convincement of Margt Fell and her children through the instrumentality of Geo. Fox, whose labours appear from his journal, to have been signally accompanied by Divine power about that time. It bears evident proofs of its having been the product of a state of spiritual childhood- of those whose sight has been dazzled by the luster of the instrument; to which they have applied appellations only due to the source from which it derived its efficacy. Geo. Fox was very careful to gather the people to Christ and there to leave them [signed "G.R"; the name "George Richardson" is pencilled in, by a different hand, beneath the intials; this endorsement occurs in the original letter only i.e. 3/25
contents: "The body of the letter heaps enormous praise upon G.F. for his guiding them to Christ; pleads for Fox's return "for in thee alone is our life and peace, and without thee have we no peace, for our soulls is much refreshed by seeing thee, and our lifes is preserved"; (lengthy postscript from M.F. [Margaret Fell, senior] acknowledging that "though thou hast shaked the dust of thy feet at him who would not receive thee, nor is not worthy of thee", they have received him [Fox] into their hearts; she reinforces the appeal for his return to them, "if it be but for two or three dayes to strike downe the deceite in him for the Truthe's sake"); [there are also brief one-line comments to Fox from Sarah, Susan, Isabel, and Mary Fell]"

Abstract: 56. M.F. [Margaret Fell] to A.P. [Alexander Parker] and W.G. [apparently this latter part of the salutation is incorrect; she apparently meant "G.W." since it is endorsed by George Fox, "G. Whighed" i.e. George Whitehead; see below]
dated: Lond[on], the 24 of the 5th mo. [July], [16]60
endorsed: M.F. to A. Parker and G. Whighed, 1660, read over, G.F. in Lankester [Lancaster], prsener [prisoner], 31 [appears to be George Fox's hand]
contents: "Although she has not written because of her service there and her heavy burdens and travels, she has not been unmindful of them and their sufferings; they are doing the service of the Lord and He will deliver them in His own time; she has laboured for five to six weeks with the great ones in power to inform them of Friend's sufferings "and the King [Charles II] hath promised much often and severall times he hath said it should bee helped and hee would looke to it, and that wee should not be abussed nor suffer for our religion"; however, she notes the difficulty of getting Friends released once they are cast into prison; the King is not suffered by "wicked bloody minded men"; thus, he once gave order to bring G.F. [George Fox] from Lancaster to be tried at London "but [General George] Monke [Monck] and ye rest that were about him would not suffer it, soe now he hath nothing to say when I goe to him but that will be give the judges orders that they shall hear Friendes and set them free, but what they will doe the Lord only knowes"; was with the King last seventh day but those around him answered and they appeared fearful the King should say anything of his own mind and they want him to act against his words concerning liberty of conscience; Friends and the Truth there are well, meetings quiet and full; at present she is stuck in London and foresees no time of her return; likely to be a time of trial for many not prepared for suffering; Colonel [Francis] Hacker, who with many more are in the Tower, is like to suffer deeply; John Swinton was apprehended the previous sixth day but she feels he will patiently endure what they will do against him"

contents: In order to allow him to understand their principles and that they are of God, they ask that "three men come before yu, and deale with them as yee see good and most for your own advantage"; they believe that he will judge them fairly for "thou are of the most temp[er]ate, milde, meeke spirit"; they desire it be done before his Declaration be given forth which was mentioned in the Chancellor's [Earl of Clarendon] speech [probably refers to the speech at the opening of the Convention Parliament; the "Declaration" would therefore be the Worcester House Declaration of 25 October 1660]

contents: God restored him and has been good to him; she asks him to fulfill the promises he made regarding tender consciences- promises made in Breday [Breda], in a speech at the last Parliament and in his Declaration concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs; "in particular, there was a promise made unto us yt wee should have a Proclamation by wch we should enjoye our meetings"; yet, they are heavily persecuted; notes that simply taking an oath imposed by force does not compel men to act contrary to their own intentions, since taking an oath is breaking Christ's command; suggests the King and his government rely on penalties established by law upon offenders according to the nature of the offence and forget about oaths; [A third sheet is in short-hand, but does not appear to relate to the above letter although the endorsement [above] is located on that sheet] 
Research Notes: dated probably late 1660

Abstract: 116. dated: [Her discussion of the sufferings of Quakers in New England since the King's letter against corporal punishment, indicates the probable date as late 1661 or early 1662, since the King's letter did not reach Boston until October, 1661]

: This was written
contents: Notes sufferings of Quakers in New England since the King's letter against corporal punishment; in Boston, a man with a wife and five children was put in the stock and whipped and Friends were fined for praying and speaking at their meetings; Anne Coleman was banished; Nicholas Upshall was confined to prison for as long as he should live; another man was made senseless by their brutality; the Boston authorities claim that they forged the King's letter; have received letters about the cruel usage from Friends in New England; some in London went to Broadstreet, a New England magistrate, with the letters; he claims that John Leveret, their agent, was informed that the King simply wanted the magistrates not to inflict the death penalty, that the King did not rebuke them for putting Quakers to death and that the King intended sharp laws against them in England; she notes Captain Oliver claimed they would persecute Friends despite the King's letter; Broadstreet implied that Friends were less sober in New England than in England; three London Friends suffered at New England- one was condemned to die; the other two had one of their ears cut; Elizabeth Hooten, at Boston two nights "could not get a bed to lie in under 20 shillings a night (they having made a law yt whosoever entertaines a Quaker should pay 20 shillings)"; she finally proferred money to buy a house and land, the former to aid strangers, the latter to bury the dead;  they lay those things before them [King Charles II and Council] for their consideration; notes also the words of Major Denison regarding "the changing of ye government of England"; the jailer at Boston told a Friend of the report that the King intended to send a new Governor and that "they intended if he did, to stand upon their guard and oppose his coming by force of armes"; all those things condemn the King's authority; several Friends have come over to testify

dated: Swarthmore, ye 18 of 8 m. [October], 1679
contents: [This is meant to be an introduction to some letters and answers to priests and professors; this document itself discusses the origins of the Fells' involvement with Quakerism]; Had not heard of the Quakers until George Fox came and spoke of the Light of Christ in their conscience and of many other things; she heard him speak those things at Ulverston steeplehouse where they had gone to hear a sermon of priest [William] Lampitt; she sat in her pew and wept while Lampitt preached "for I saw yt all yt we had before was nothing worth"; Lampitt had allowed Fox to speak, thinking the latter would be in agreement with him; seeing otherwise, he sent for the Churchwardens to hail Fox out, but they allowed him to continue; finally, Justice John Sawrah [Sawrey] had him hailed out; many besides her were convinced and the Truth grew and increased; many went to the Steeplehouse to cry against the priests; the professors and priests thought it the work of the devil and called them witches and sorcerers and treated them accordingly; they could not persecute those at her house at Swarthmore since her husband [Judge Thomas Fell] was chief magistrate in the county; all the ministers were outside the doctrine of Christ; they ressembled those who had opposed Christ when he was upon the earth; the priests, alarmed at a powerful attack on their false foundations, petitioned Parliament and the two Crumwells [Oliver and Richard Cromwell] against the Quakers and began to write against them; "I was but younge in ye Truth yet I had a perfect and a pure testimony of God in my heart for God and His Truth"; she answered their charges and few of them ever answered again; all of that occurred some 26 or 27 years past; [their follows several biblical references and passages which apparently were used against the priests and professors by the Quakers- they include Psalm 58, Psalm 140, Isaiah 27, Matthew 23, Mark 12, Mark 3:29, John 6:70, The Acts 13:10, John 8:44, 1 John 3:8, Romans 13:2, Mark 16:16, Romans 14:3 [this was a mistake; the passage refers to Romans 14:23], 2 Thessalonians 2:12, 2 Thessalonians 1:8]

Abstract: 131. dated: 1653 [endorsed; however, their is some question as to the date; Works, p.39 and Ross, p.143 imply this was written in the early 1660's; on the other hand, the trial of Cuthbert Hunter [see below] took place on 2 August 1654 thus placing the date of this letter in 1654]
endorsed: A leter to Judg Windom [by George Fox; however "leter" is crossed out and the endorsement has been altered by a different hand to read "2, An answer to Judge Windom by M.F., 1653"]
contents: She notes Judge [Sir Hugh] Windham's comment in his charge [to the jury] that the Quaker principle of the Light in every one would lead into all manner of sin; she disputes this, noting the Light is "ye condemnation of all sin"; "Oh, yt ever such should be sett up to be a judge who utters forth such blasphemy"; read John 1:9 relating to the Light; the Light shall witness against Judge Windham "who should be a judge upon ye evil [but] art found to be a judge upon ye good"; analysis of the doctrine of the Light; read John 3; she notes Windham's remarks were made in the case involving Cuthbert Hunter, tried for adultery and fornication for marrying without priests, but rather "according to ye man[n]our as he found in Scripture"; Windham claimed also that "it is contrary to ye Law of God and contrary to ye Law of man"; she asserts the falseness of that statement and that Hunter married in the Light and it was witnessed by those in the Light; she does admit that Hunter did not enter the Truth until half a year after his marriage but nonetheless he "did take his wife after ye example of ye Saints in Scripture"; all marriages not of the Light must be condemned

: [The following is appended to the bottom of the letter, probably by Margaret Fell- "This aforesd pap[er] was writte to Jo[hn] Sawrey called a justice, a great p[er]secutor, one of ye first in ye north that set ye rude multitude to beat Friends, who set many in ye stocks and put in prison and M.F. was moved to goe to ye Steplehouse to speak to ye priest of ye p[ar]ish, where she and he lived and when she was in ye Steeplehouse, he came to her and said, "Good Ms Fell, goe into your own pew or else goe your way", and he took her by ye arme and offered to pull her away, but she said, "Hold thy hands off me", and she spoak to ye priest wt [what] she had to speak, and afterward she spoak to him and she charge[d] him to doe justice and not to wrong nor oppress ye poor people, wherupon he was vexed and writ a letter to her and sent it to her husband and charged her to prove what injustices he had done. So this letter is an answ[er] to his, and within a few years after [he] was drowned in a little ["little" is crossed out] water upon the rode co[m]ing from York [torn slightly; this endorsement is fully transcribed in Ross, p. 40]
contents: Lengthy appeal to him to repent and turn to the Lord or like a caterpillar, "bee swept out of ye way"; his "filthie high pharisaicall nature" keeps down God within him and he must let the latter rise up and "keepe downe the lustfull, jearinge, heardened nature wch is in thee"; notes his letter to her, though it came to her husband first; was full of lies; she denies his charges that she lied or that she was puffed up with malice and pride; she calls him a hypocrite; asks him to leave his "alehouse haunteinge" and his "tendringe of oathes to pore, ignorant people"; Jesus had commanded not to swear; she cites instances where he has done injustice- the case involving Dodgson "of the lawecoate" and Arthur Longe, the warrant granted to Richard Waller of Cartmell but his [Sawrey] refusal to prosecute the man who had been bound over, his actions against Richard Waller and family; she notes those are but three instances and "multitudes might bee added"; her husband [Judge Thomas Fell] would never do injustices such as instanced above; she accuses him of forcing poor people to buy him drinks at the alehouse day after day; he speaks of grace yet does not keep at home; "thou art ye woman yt goes abbroade and dost not abbide in thy owne house"; he should remember the parable of that woman, but "thou art ignorant of the parables"; despite his accusations against her, "if ever thou wittnesse the Truthe, thou wilt wittnesse mee"; his God is of the world and "thou shalt know to ye destroyeinge of thee and thy God, what God wee serve" [three sides]

Abstract: 151-152. dated: 1656 [endorsed]
endorsed: A paper from M.F. to Gor. Brathweth, 1656
: 13, A p[ro]fessor
contents: She notes his claim that he "canst not be perswaded but that our religion stands in works"; she speaks to the Light in his conscience "that with it thou mayst see thy blindness and ignorance of God"; it is he [Braythwaite] who is in the "covenant of works and selfe actings and self righteousnes"; the Quakers teach obedience to the Light; read Romans [1:1,4,5], Romans 5:19, Romans 6:16; also read the Apostle Peter "when hee wrote to ye S[ain]ts elect according to ye foreknowledge of God"; she again asserts that he "dost not know ye teaching of ye spirit of God at all"; he "dost not know ye teaching of ye spirit of God at all"; he must not follow Priest [Gabriel] Camilford who is "a blinde guide" nor others like him, "for they are without God"; he [Braythwaite] rejects the word of the Lord, although the latter has been good to him; as a consequence, the Lord will reject him; read 1 Samuel 15[:23] and Deuteronomy 4:13 [this should be 4:30]; it is not too late for him to repent and become obedient to the Lord; read Isaiah 1:19-20; however, "if thou go on in thy disobedience and rebellion then ["then" is crossed out], when ye day of thy calamity comes thou wilt remember mee"; Camilford and those like him will also answer for their sins [three sides]

: This letter ["letter" is crossed out and "pap[er]" is written above it] is an answere to one yt Jeffrey Eletson writt to Jo: Clayton who was a souldier wth him ye army in Scotland, who came to be convinced of ye Truth, and Eletson hearing of it, writt a letter to him, and Jo: Clayton brought it to M.F. to answer [this is at the bottom of the letter] 
contents: Although having said "my letter was welcome to thee, that in thy conscience will tell thee thou lyes"; [it appears that Margaret is writing the letter as if John Clayton was the author of it]; speaks to his conscience "but thee I deny"; he has called them [Quakers] deluded people and expressed sorrow because he [Clayton] has gone with them; "Let thy sorrow turne backe for thy selfe"; he [Clayton] has discovered the true, living God which is "the unknowne God to thee"; by saying "that some of them [Quakers] will be saved, though by fire...thou makes it manifest that thou speakes evill of that thou knowes not"; he will be condemned by the eternal spirit, as will all who think as he does; he is a hypocrite and a dissembler; "thou art for condemnacon and distruction by the fire"; it is he who is deluded "who blasphemes God and His temple"; what he knows of Christ was simply what he read in his [Clayton] letter "but Chr[ist] Jesus wthin thee thou art ignorant of"; he is an enemy to "them that deny ungodlynesse"; "if thou harken to that in thy conscience it will condemne thee with mee, for that I have unitie with, but thee I deny"; his defence of the ministers of England shows his ignorance for they do not teach the living God and are Antichrist; Jesus will destroy him; he must repent and turn to the Light in his conscience and obey it; "Jesus XT is rissen and revealed and made manifest in these whom thou and thy gospell ministers calls deluded people"; he must also beware of how he speaks of the Scriptures "for they are anothers and are not thine" [2 1/2 sides closely written; it is signed by "M.F." but a postscript is added, signed by "John Clayton"- "Writen from ye moving of ye spirit of ye Lord in one of them whome thou cales deluded, in love to thy soull. This is ye word of ye Lord to thee Jefray Elatson. Do not thou cale this railling, for if thou doast, in soe doing thou heaped coales of fier upon thy oune head"]

: To Jeffrey Ellettson [possibly by George Fox], 1654 one of ye same p[ro]fession wth mee whom I loved dearly [probably by Margaret Fell]
contents: She speaks to the Light of Jesus within him; she asserts that God spoke forth the Scriptures "soe if thou doe not know that wch gave forth the Scripture, how canst thou know yt God which was in them which gave it forth?"; he must examine God in his conscience to see what he possesses of the living God; by analogy, she asks him if he could live simply on the writings and covenants of an inheritance but not the things they spoke of; yet he professes the words of the living God but "without the substance and the life that spoke it"; turn to the Light and it will show "that thou art yet in Egipt and utter darknes"; he does not know Moses who was sent "to bringe the seed out of the house of darknes and bondage"; she reminds him that once she was in that profession more than he, even though he had left the country in search of more knowledge of God; yet, she found the true God and "that which was a barren wildernes is become a fruitfull hill"; warns him against making an image or likeness of Truth "for God forbidds all images and liknesses, in heaven above or in earth beneath"; he must repent, for he is blind and ignorant of God; "if ever thou know the true and livinge God, thou must owne us"

contents: She fears he goes against his conscience because he denies the Light in it "wch checkes yu when you act contrary to it"; she is moved to warn him once more to look to the Light; "Thou p[ro]fesseth a God and a Chr[ist] in words...but in workes denyes all" by denying the Light of Christ; she elaborates on her thesis regarding the Light and the Truth by brief comments on the Pharisees, the Gentiles and the Apostles; regarding the latter, for example, she notes "the Apostles walked by the manifestation of Truth commendinge themselves to every mans' conscience in the sight of God"; read Hebrews 9-10; concludes by noting she has love for his soul and he must take heed of this warning

: [In the middle of the second side, there is an address apparently unrelated to this letter- "For Margorat Fell at Swarthmor in Low Furnes, this with care"; although it appears directly in the middle of the text on that side, it does not interrupt the text in any way, which is unusual; perhaps Margaret wrote the letter on paper used previously and simply wrote around the address]
contents: Writes in tender love for his soul; reminds him of his former love and zeal for God and how he went seeking for Him, but now that God calls, he seems to want to run away "because yt His name and Truth goeth under reporache (as it ever did)"; turn to God "yt Hee may purge your ["your" is crossed out] thy conscience from dead works"; "will you not come unto Him that thou may have life?"; however, as long as he walks contrary to that in his conscience he is "under judgement and condemnation", not can he ever evade the Judge; she notes this is the third time she has written him "in obeydience to the moving of the spirit of the Lord"

contents: She notes that in the beginning of his paper, he seemed to own the Light in his conscience, but by the end, he had denied and opposed that concept; [What follows is a lengthy response to statements he made in his paper relating to his feelings about the Light, his claims that he is a sinner who will attain mercy, that he confesses with the Apostle, that he strives to become a new creature, his query whether God has given them a special revelation or a new warning, his belief in only those prophecies set down in Scripture [etc]; she concludes by noting he is ignorant of God and of His Truth; warns him to turn to "that in thy conscience wch shewes thee ye deceipt of thy heart"; he is warned in his lifetime; Scriptural references include the following- Romans 14:23, 2 Peter 2:12, Romans 13, Colossians 2:20[,21,22], Matthew 26:29, Luke 22:18, 1 Corinthians 11:23 [this passage appears to refer to 1 Corinthians 11:25] and Romans 6:3 [Four sides closely written]

Abstract: 160. dated: 1656
endorsed: This was given forth after a dispute at Manchester with Independents, Baptists and [Fifth] Monarchy Men about 1656; is on that profess[ion] [at the top of the document; there follows what appears to be a signature- perhaps M.F. [Margaret Fell]- the endorsement appears to be in her handwriting]
:1656, 19 [in the margin on the second side; this is followed by what may be a name, but is indiscipherable]
contents: [It appears that part of this document is missing, as it begins in the middle of a sentence]; She/He warns the Presbyterians, Independents and other sects that "yu are confused and divided in your vaine thoughts and imaginations"; Scriptures prove they are the Anti-Christs "which John speakes of which shall be in the last tymes"; read 1 John 2:18 and 1 John 4:2-3; she/he notes that those sects look for Christ to come and they mock the Quakers when they ask "what will yu Quakers doe who saith Christ [is] within yu, when Christ comes in the clouds?"; she/he warns that those who ask such a question forget the Apostle [John; see above] "who said every spirit who doth not confesse Him come in the flesh is not of God"; some of them utterly deny the Scriptures- like William Barret who denied 1 Peter 1:9 and Richard Herrick, who denied at Manchester "that Christ's body is spirituall"; she/he warns the poeple of Manchester to consider what they are being led into by such men who do not know the body of Christ; it is a case of the blind leading the blind; they emphasize Scripture rather than the Light "and soe betrayes poore people, and keepes their soules in death"; those who desire to know the living God and the Lord's body must turn to the Light; "Search into the Scriptures and yu will see them, the deceivers of your soules...for nothing...in that which they call their worshipp is accordinge to the Scriptures; while at variance among themselves, [Major John] Wiggin [Wigan], [Samuel] Eaton, Herricke [Herrick], Barret and [Richard] Hollingsworth [Hollingworth] "agree together in opposinge and p[er]secutinge the Truth"; the meeting, appointed by them, had been in an uproar; again warns the people to turn towards the Light "which is the world's condemnation, for the Light is the condemnation of the world and all the Antichrists that are in the world"

Abstract: dated: Kingston, ye 21 of ye 1st month [March], 1678 [There is doubt about this date; a letter has been inserted into the MSS from Isabel Ross to "My dear Muriel", dated 21 February 1946, which gives several reasons for her belief that the correct date is March 1673/4; she feels Margaret Rous simply wrote the wrong date; the letter does, in fact, indicate the latter date to be correct]
addressed:
endorsed: [On the addressed portion, someone has written a list of vegetables as if for a recipe or shopping list]
contents: All are well; however, "I have been since my goeing abroad after my lying in very much troubled wth a violent paine in my head"; much better the past two or three weeks; Tom [apparently their son, Thomas Rous, born 12 November 1673, died 26 April 1674] had been very ill but has recovered; rest of the children are well; very cold weather there; wheat, barley, mutton and beef are very scarce and dear and likely to get worst; father [George Fox] must go to Worchester [for trial]; [The next section is difficult to transcribe accurately due to Margaret's indiscriminate use of the pronouns "he" and "him", which cause confusion as to when she is speaking of Thomas Lower or of George Fox; an effort is made here to transcrible it intuitively and by utilising other available information; however, the reader is wise to carefully examine the document and not to rely on this listing]; she went to London "yt week bro[ther Thomas] Lower went and got him [G.F.] to Kingston"; he [G.F.] stayed three nights and then T. Ridger's brother came "and posted him in all hast away"; scarcely had time to speak to him, "it was unsertaine whether he went or not [to Worcester]"; many Friends "were imployed in speaking to judges and shrief [sheriff], King [Charles II] and Counsell to procure his stay but it seemes hee must goe ye [they] say next weeke"; the judges had granted a warrant; Friends had hoped things would fall out differently then brother Lower represented; he [G.F.] had feared they would hurry him down "hot being able to indue it"; love to her, to Leo[nard] and Mary Fell, to Jo[seph] and Jane Nicolson and to Friends; "Betty Walker is well and remembers her duty to her fa[ther] and mo[ther]" [part of this letter damaged]
