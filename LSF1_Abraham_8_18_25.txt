Hee [Samuel Fisher] will not lett it bee knowen unto mee yt hee sees any clearnes of goeing wth mee, but tells mee hee knowes not but something may bee upon him to ye Jewes in Amsterdam in Holland, and hee thinkes to have liberty to.goe over thyther, but it's like hee cannot conveniently goe till about that tyme they call Michaelmas, and from thence he knowes nothing but of returneing backe.

I dare not but thinke well of him for the Seed's sake, but this I knowe, yt what I received was eternall, and soe I is to waite to submitt to [y]e will of the Mover... I have made litle speech of it to any though it hath beene propounded to mee by m[any?],... yt if hee should not goe, I hope the Truth shall not suffer in it"; was once free "to tell him in much feare yt if hee did not goe, hee would suffere losse and hee tells mee yt word stickes closse to him. His [Samuel Fisher's] wife his [is] weake in body and noe likelyhood of removeing. Thy books called 'The Second Call to the Seed of Izraell' [published as A Loving Salutation to the Seed of Abraham; Wing F634] was a while agoe finished and as hee [Samuel Fisher?] hath opportunity, hee goes one in Hebrew wth the first [the Hebrew edition of printed in 1660]. It's difficult. Alsoe thy Epistle it's finished. I have them both in latin. I entended to have them printed in one volume in Holland, to witt, the Hebrew coppie and the other two in Latin. My service is likely to bee in Buckinghamshire for the tyme I stay. I desire ye to lett mee knowe whether... thou wilt have thee books... printed and bound upp in one or severall. I can send to William Caton according to thy direction, but I put of[f] till I heare from ye about them all. I dare not goe about to stoppe my wife's [Elizabeth] comeing to mee, neither to provoke her in it, but humbly leaves it to ye Lord and to her owne measure and to ye and the Children of Light whom it may concern to judge of.

And ag[ai]n Justice Fleeming, consider when John Stubbs was brought before y[o]u, having a wife [Elizabeth] and four smale children and little to live on,...which as soon as ever he appeared, thou cryed 'put the Oath [of Allegiance] to that man and when hee confessed hee was but a poor man, yet...y[o]u had no regard, but cast away pitty and not hearing what hee would say, and so now hee is kept up in prison because hee would not sweare"; queries whether he would have cast Christ and the Apostles into prison "if they had been in ye dayes which c[om]mands not to sweare at all"; also "can allegiance bee to ye King in going to that which Christ and ye Apostle saith is evill"; as for John Stubbs, now that he is kept in prison "thou wilt surely take order wth his family yt his children do not starve and see yt they do not want bread. And also W[illia]m Wilson, parish and neighbours which was industrious, known to all ye parish and neighbour and carefull to maintaine his wife and children and so had little but what hee gott by his hands in dilligence and travels to supply himself,...and how should his wife maintaine her children and thou cast her husband in prison and make him uncapable by tendering ye Oath to him and putting him in prison,...for the noyce of it is in ye very marketts, and ye death of thy two neighbours"; queries whether John Stubbs and [William Wilson] would not have their liberty if they has simply gone "to a Mountybank and a stage play or...to a hunting and sweare"; asks him to consider for "wee know ye King's mind is ty there should bee no cruelty inflicted upon his peaceable subjects"; several "poor, honest people were fined, who had more need to have given them something"; all of his neighbours know this as well as his country people that some were fined "lives upon the charity of other people"; what honour or grace can be gained by casting his neighbors into prison simply because "they cannot swear nor take an oath"; yet "have not many of y[o]u first sworn on[e] way and then another way, for people knowes ye Quakers principle yt it's year and nay, and they know they keep to their yea and their nay"; thus "wee leave it to ye spirit of God in y[o]ur consciences and to Justice Flemming who was so swift for takeing Georg[e] Fox and so grieved at them yt had not taken him"; warns him to "take heed of Herod's hard heartedness and casting away all pitty. Esau did so and not Jacob. Also Thomas Walters of Boutle [Bootle] is cast into prison and imposed the Oath upon him through thee, and for denying to sweare at all,...hee is continued in prison, who hath 5 smale children and his wife at down lying. Surely thou wilt take care for them also"; queries how he will answer at the day of Judgement having stained himself 'wth ye b[lood] of ye Innocent" when, in fact, he might have "done good" among his peaceable neighbours; "The King's [Charles II] favour and his mercy and clemency to sober people to tender consciences hath been largly manifested, wch thou hast abused in persecuting his peaceable subjects, for at Lonfdon and in other parts the Quaker's meettings are peaceable"; [the next two lines are damaged but in Ellwood's edition of Fox's Journal, p.280, it appears that the lines refer to Yorkshire where the plot had been an that Friends innocency there had been accepted by the Justices]; emphasizes that the law "was not made for ye righteous but for sinner and transgessors"; nonetheless, 'ye Quakers can say 'ye Lord forgive thee' and lay not these thinges to thy charge if it bee His will"; (Postscript- [there are 13 lines in cipher as well as the following] notes the case of W[illia]m Grave "to whom thou hast pretended much love and friendship, and whom thou hast cast into prison, and what thou would do for him, who came hither to ye service of ye countrey, and when he came hither, his service would not be taken, upon wch the Oath was tendred to him as a snare, and so was kept in prison untill ye Sessions, and when the Oath was tendred to him ag[ai]n then thou never open[e]d thy mouth as for his good, though thou knew him to bee thy neighbour and the cause of his first commitment,...and so thou maist remember what thou saidst to his wife, being a justice, both of Lancashire and Westmorland and Cumberland, so now thou maist see what is thy work on his behalfe, as knowing before hee could not swear") 
: This is printed, with some small differences and without the pistscript in Thomas Ellwood's edition of George Fox's Journal, I, 278-280
: The postscript has been printed [except for the cipher] in JFHS, VII (September, 1910), 146
Research Notes: Letter is signed by a L.M. but the endorsement "notes this as the work of George Fox and Fox in his Journal ascribes it to the prisoners at Lancaster." I've kept L.M. as the sender, but it is likely that L.M. refers to George Fox. Daniel Fleming has both the Justice and Sir titles, chose to encode Justice but can change to Sir if preferred. No explicit locations named.

Contents: Love to her, to G.F. [George Fox] to sister Rachell [Fell] and to all Friends; "Thy letter to my sister Mary [Fell] by last post we rec[eive]d. I was once with my sister to speake with my brother [George] Fell, but he was not at home, and since I was there and carried thy letter to him, and then they said he was gone to Whitehall. We have not seen him now about a fortnight and soe know not what he hat[h] done, or how farre he hath proceeded [in gaining Margaret Fell's estate]"; have spoken with Thomas Speed "who was last weeke with him at Whitehall where he searched ye record where all such things, if they are given away, are entred, and T.S. told me they could not find yt it was then granted to any one. My sister [Mary Fell] told me my brother [George Fell] was with Coll[onel Richard] Kirkby and that he was very courteous to him, but it is well knowne what his fair words come to. I forgot in my last to give thee an acc[oun]t of what I had done about the £36 my brother was to pay Rob[er]t Dring"; details relating to that matter; "When I have an answer to my last to thee, I may write further to that bussines"; the past week, "I rec[eive]d a letter from P[eter?] Evans wherin was enclosed a very bad one to thee, wch I doe not judge worth paying postage for soe farre [probably from Barbados] nor worth troubling thee with, but this I perceive by his letter they were [a]ll much troubled at thine and he thinkes it may be much prejudice to me, for he thus writes, 'I desire thee by the next to write to thy father [Lieutenant- Colonel Thomas] and mother and excuse thyselfe in this matter for I perceive the thing may worke much to thy prejudice else and thy father will not signe the bond [John Rous had asked his father to settle £20,000 on him and if he died, on his wife and children; see Isabel Ross, Margaret Fell, mother of Quakerism, p.187], neither will there be need for thee to presse it either in relation to thy selfe or wife [Margaret nee Fell, junior], for I perceive his intentions are clear concerning thee (without such things as that letter should turne them)'. I am well satisfied concerning his intentions towards me while I live, but my desire is to get the bond signed yt if I should die, my wife nor children, if the Lord please to give me any, may not suffer, but I thinke it may be well to forbear urging it till their spirits are more downe, and in the meane time if my signing a bond my doe any good, I shalbe very willing and shall after a while...write to my father to signe that, but I perceive that ye greatnes of ye obligation being £20,000 is something stumbled at, soe yt if thou thinke fit, it be £10,000 or £12,000. wch it may be will not be so much looked at, I shall be willing to do what may be thought necessarie for me to doe, for I would not have anything wanting to secure to my wife yt wch is allready granted her, for I looke upon it she very well deserves it if it had been more. My wife rec[eive]d G.F.'s [George Fox's]...lines wch I forgot to mention in my last, being taken up soe much wth yt busines"; about 50 were taken "from ye Bull and Mouth [the Friends meeting house at Aldersgate] yesterday and about 18 from Mile End"; wife [Margaret] and siser [Mary Fell?] "are both well and remember their dear love to thee and G.F., as also doth Thomas Coveney, Elizabeth Trot [Trott], Marg[are]t Drinkell [Drinkwell] and Mary Strutt. There is great expectation of a war with the Dutch and many ships are a fitting for it"; (Postscript- "I had this day a letter from my brother [William] Yeamans and they were both well. Thy letter to my brother and sister [Isabel nee Fell] Yeamans I send by ye post last 7th day")

W[he]n I was in Jo[h]n Hull's place with thy husband. I was not behinde in writeing frequently, but now I judge it superfluous to write soe often in regard thou maist have a more perfect account from thy sonne Rouse of John Hull or both"; however, now feels it is his duty to write "to give thee an account of thinges here at present in this Island"; firstly, "thy husband is finely well and...pretty stronge and rides abroad to meetings from one side of ye Island to another, and hath been soe some weekes"; only giving a present account, since "the account...I sent to W[illia]m Dundas...was ordered to be sent to thee, wch I hope is comed to thy hands some weeks since"; about three weeks past 'thy husband went to visite ye Governour [Colonel Christopher Codrington, the Lt-Governor] att his owne house, and he was very civilly and kindly...treated of him. Lewis Morrice [Morris], [Lt.Colonel] Thomas Rouse [Rous, father of John] and I thinke his 2 sons [John and Thomas?] and John Hull wth other Friends went along,...and there they continued most part of ye day and dined there alsoe and yt week thy husband came doen to the Bridge Town [Bridgetown] haveing not been there before but ad he passed through it w[he]n he came into ye Island"; it so happened that the general meeting was the same week 'yt thy husband was wth ye Governour, and his kind reception wth the Governor did give a sound among ye officers, both military and civill throughout ye Island insoemuch as they came from all parts of ye Island,...andyt not of ye least rank as Collonels and Justices and Ju[d]ges and Captaines and soe forth came to this Generall Meeting"; hearing of that, "thy husband would be at it, and after thy son Rouse, Tho[mas] Brigge [Briggs], W[illia]m Baylife [Bayly] had spoken, then thy husband spoke,...but he was straitned for time, and indeed I was greeved from my very heart for it, and they cannot but suffer yt was ye cause of it", but "I must be short"; then after meeting "he passed to Lewis Morrice house yt night wch was about 9 or 10 miles distant, partly performing his jorney...along ye sea co[a]st in a boat and the rest upon horsse back by land, and there he continued about a week. There is ye finest ayre in ye Island about Lewis, his plantac[i]on. The next day after he went to Lewis Morrice's, Thomas Briggs and W[illia]m Edmondson went to him to take their leave of him, being to passe to Antegoe [Antiqua] and Mevia [Nevis] ye following day, wch was upon ye seaventh day of the week, just this day 2 weeks. They passed away from thy husband at yt place and Lewis is gone along with them. Soe here is at present thy husband and Solomon [Eccles] and I an upon first day meettings thy son Rouse helps us. Wm Bayliffe is here. The people in a manner generally affects him very much and it's well"; there are mighty great meetings in the island and "a very great convincement in all parts"; "Thy husband hath had severall meettings among ye men and women Friends to ye generall satisfaction of all Friends in ye Island. He hath had 2 great First day meettings at Thomas Rouse's, it being ye greatest meetting in ye Island except this generall meeting at ye Town aforementioned. Now tomorrow being ye First day, I think he will have a meeting at one Jo[h]n Holder's who is a Justice of Peace. Solomon and I have been there already at 2...meetings. The Truth is fre[e]ly preached both to white people and black people.

Endorsed: Aunt Mead's Letter to my d[ea]r and affectionate mother; J[ohn] Abraham
Contents: Has endeavoured to fit mother [Margaret Fox nee Fell] "with blacke clothe for a gowne, wch is very good and fine, and as much as Jo[h]n Richards saith is enough to ye full, 5 y[a]rds and a halfe, and what materieals as hee thought was needfall to send downe,...and I was very glad to know what shee wanted, for it has been in my minde a pretty while to send her and you somethinge, and I could not tell what shee might need ot might be most serviceable to her" which accounts for the lengthy forbearance, and "soe I desire her acceptance of it and yours of these smale things under written"; [their follows a list of items sent as gifts for "brother [Daniel] Abraham", "sister [Mary] Lower [nee Fell]", "sister [Isabel] Yeamans [nee Fell]", as well as for mother [Margaret Fox] and for herself [Rachel Abraham]; "Sister Susannah [Fell], understanding from Sister [Isabel] Yeamans yt Hen[ry] Coward expected somethinge from her for ye care hee had tooke about her money, (though shee did not reckon herselfe behinde, if things of all hands were considered), yett as a smale acknowledgm[en]t of his care and respect in it, shee hath sent him and his wife [Ellen nee Green] each a pare of doeskinn gloves, wch shee desires thee to send them"; also, "here is for Sister [Mary] Lower, wch shee sent to Sister Susannah [Fell] to buy her a coulered stuffe [material, probably wool] Monteo [Manteau- a loose upper garment worn by women], cost 14s, and 11 ye[ar]ds and halfe of blacke worsted stuffe at 2s p[er] ye[ar]d, cost 22s. Sister Sus[annah] yeilded 23s, 6d, soe shee is out of purse for her 12s, 6d. Black stuffe was worse to gett then coulered, wch is now mostly worne of such course things, but shee hath done as well as shee cann and hopes it will doe well and please her. Also sister Lower sent for wch sister Susannah sends to ye childe for a token and hopes it may suite her well. I feared it was to smale a print, but severale tells us it's fittest for a childe haveing younge eyes and should learne all prints, both smale and great. Sister [Isabel] Yeamans sent to mee for Will[iam] Yeamans [son of Isabel and her late husband William] old close [clothes]yt hee had left of[f] weareing, for Ja[mes] Geldart and Dan[iel] Cooper. I have sent for them, but it's such a crosse way to where hee us, they are not yett come, nor I feare, will not before Ja[mes] Geldart goe out of towne, soe I must send her them by the carier, and if they bee not worth cariage, I cannott helpe it, it was her owne request to have them. Shee mentioned Ja. Geldart goeing yt way for them, but it is to[o] much out of his way and not worth his while. Tell her shee did not loose her needle case here nor at Bridgett's [unidentified, but possibly Brudget Rous, daughter of John and Margaret, who died in 1683, the year of this letter] roome yt wee cann heare off. Also, tell her Mary Frith presents her service to her and takes it kindely yt shee should send her fillett"; love to mother [Margaret Fox] from her [Sarah Meade], from husband [William Meade] and from sister Susannah Fell?], and love also "to thee, to bro[ther Daniel Abraham?], and to sister [Isabel] Yeamans and sister [Mary] Lower"; (Postscript- "Wee advise you to make my mother's cloth gowne without a skirt wch is very civill and usually soe worne, both by younge and old in stiffned suites. I send my mother's bookes and papers yt were in my father's [George Fox] chest as shee desired, but my husband [William Meade] desired to have ye King's [Charles II's] grant kept a while longer, being there will bee some occasion for it about brother [Thomas] Lower's businesse and I hope it will bee noe prejudice to you. Also I send my sister [Susannah] Fell's bond, wch belonges to the last articles shee made to my mother. It was left here thorrow [through] some mistake amonge other papers. Bee carefull of it and putt it to the articles of yt bargaine. You doe not know but you may have occasion for it hereafter. I have putt it in the paper amonge your gloves where thou may finde it")

Contents: "Thine of ye 20th instant [December] I rec[eive]d last night, wch I read to my father [George Fox], hee lodging here tonight, and as to ye acc[oun]t betwixt thee and sister Susannah [Fell], it is that thou owed her when I came out of the north £61, 00s, 05d and that she laid out for thee of her owne money while shee was in the north by herselfe before thou went downe more, £19, 01s, 08d, both sumes being £80, 02s, 01d. I reckon thou has p[ai]d her of it thus, £22 out of my father's p[ar]t of ye forge [probably Force Forge, in Furness] money, wch I mentioned in my last, wch shee had in Tho[mas] Rawlinson's £100 and thou writt yt thou putt out for her last Candlemas £40 upon Joseph Nickolson's [Nicholson's] land, both wch sumes that thou hath p[ai]d her is £62, 00s, 00d. And now thou owes her £18, 2s,1d wch is in full of all ye money shee laid out for thee yt I know of"; as full and as plain an account "as I can give, which I hope will bee to thy understanding and satisfied with at that time, but then it goes out of your mindes againe, and it seemes strange to you afterwards, haveing not thought of it a pretty time. Wherefore, to prevent further mistakes and trouble, I would advise sister [Rachel Abram [Abraham] to putt it downe in a booke by way of acc[oun]t what was oweinge to sister Susan, and how p[ai]d her, as alsoe ye £122 oweinge to my father and then at any time when you have a minde to know, it is but lookeing into that booke, and you may know how ye acc[oun]t stands without ye trouble of lookeing out former letters wch mentions such acc[oun]ts and matters, wch shee may easily enter in a booke out of this letter now when it is fresh in her minde. Wee are glad to heare thou art better of ye fitt of gripeinge and collicke. The weather is very sharpe and cold here, it being a hard frost with some snow. It's pretty hard for poore Freinds to stand in ye streett...beinge kept out of their meettinge houses [by the authorities], but the lord preserves beyond expectation, though it goes pretty hard with some and severall has sore colds. You had need to keep warme and putt on good store of clothes"; hope that the Lord "will preserve thee in health and lengthen thy days"; Friends expect that "you should keep and exact acc[oun]t of all your sufferings, goods were taken from everyone, for what, and the value, and bee putt to the rest of Friends' sufferrings yt are presented to ye Kinge [Charles II], wch you may doe well to take care in"; Ja[mes] Geldart "went out of towne yesterday. I have sent ye box at top there is a letter for her mentioning what is sent in ye box, to wch letter I referr you. Also hee hath 2 p[ar]cells more, one for sister [Mary] Lower and 1 for sister [Isabel] Yeamans, wch there came orders for after the box was putt up. Yt for sister Lower is a featherbed ticke[?]...that shee sent to bro[ther John] Rous to buy for her. I send with this letter one to sister Lower from brother [Thomas Lower], wch had laid somewhere by ye way, for it should have come last weeke. Wee thought it longe yt wee heard not from him [Lower was at that time imprisoned in Launceston, having been praemunired], but I suppose the reason was ye letters were stopt, either by ye stormy weather or some other way. His businesse here [in London, where Friends were trying to secure his release] lies as it did, not p[er]fected The court has beene very busy of lare. Great wheeles moves slowly, but wee have good hopes to effect it in time. I would have sister Yeamans know wee heare Fr[ancis] Rogers is maried to ye younge widdow [Katherine Dowlen] yt hee was about, but ye truth of it we know not [in fact, he did not marry her until 8 January 1684/5; for more on Fracis Rogers and Isabel Yeamans see JFHS, XII (1915), 56-58], and yt Hannah Marshall [wife of Charles Marshall] is come to lodge at Jo[h]n Plant's in Bridgett's [unidentified; see also number 25] roome and being pretty neare her time, I heare is to lie in there. Mary Woolley [wife of Ezekiel Woolley] much as shee was. Some hopes of her recovery. Eliz[abeth] Haries [Harris's] sonn yt came from beyond sea, I heare is to marry Martha Wright's younger daughter that comes to meettings. They are indifferant well at Kingstone [Kingston-upon-Thames] as I heare and litle Marg[are]t Rous is pretty well againe. Wee are alsoe pretty well here"; love to her and to brothers and sisters there from "my husband [William Meade], sister [Susannah Fell] and selfe"; (Postscript- "Sister Susannah [Fell] entreates sister [Rachel] Abraham to gett her £50 in from Jo[h]n Hodgson of Lancaster and yt shee would please to lett her know when shee may expect it, and likewise shee would have you call in yt £40 laid upoin Jos[seph] Nickolson [Nicholson's] land yt shee may have it now at Candlemas, if possible, for shee was never satisfied yt yt money should bee lent to him. These 2 sum[m]es above wth that £10 yt Jo[h]n Bell pays in of hers makes £100 wch shee desires might bee returned up together at Candlemas next with ye intrest of it and ye intr[est] of yt oweinge at Lanc[ast]er, in wch shee prayes your care")

Abstract: 36. A Pedigree of the Chetham family, written apparently by Joseph Foster and sent by him to "My dear Miss Abraham" [see below] in 1876. The Pedigree begins in the mid-sixteenth century and ends in the early nineteenth century. Included is the marriage of Mary, daughter of John Abraham to Edward Chetham of Chetham and Nuthurst, son of Edward Chetham of Chetham and Smedley, and Alice, daughter of Robert Wilson of Smedley. The marriage took place in 1683. It is noted also that Mary Abraham was buried on 27 Feb[ruary] 1706. The marriage apparently produced two children- Edward Chetham and Alice Chetham. [Mary Abraham, unlike her father, was not a Quaker,nor was her husband; see JFHS, XI (October, 1914), 173]. On the other side of the pedigree is in the following letter: Joseph Foster to "My dear Miss [Emma C. ?] Abraham"
Dated: 21, Boundary Road, St. John's Wood, London, 18 July 1876
Addressed:
Endorsed: Chetham Pedigree [by Joseph Foster at the top of the letter]
Contents: While digging away "at my peerage, I have unearthed a Chetham pedigree, and as I think it will be of great interest to you, I have copied it over on the inside of this"; received it the previous day from the Frere family; W[illiam] Langton, of Manchester "is supposed to be editing the 'Visitation of Lancashire of 1532'. Those already published are 1567, 1613, and 1666. I do not think it is actually necessary that the drawings of the arms sh[oul]d be returned"; would be sufficient simply to "let me know the blazon of it"; believes that it was "'On a chevron between 3 etoiles as many towers'"; sends love to Mr Abraham and to "your Aunt, and if Henry is with you, please give him my love"

Contents: Has not written of late, believing that brother [Daniel] Abraham "has acquaint[e]d you of his owne affaires, and what else hath been proper for your enformation"; also thought it would be better not to write "dureinge ye time of his abode here"; however "wee beinge under ye excercise of his buisiness, as wee are sensable yee are much more, being more imediately concerned in ye country, I tho[ugh]t convenient to give you a short account how things stand at ye present. Ye matter is not as yet brought before ye Debuty [Deputy] Remembrancer to be taxed [for more on the subject of this letter see JFHS, XI (October, 1914), 177], but depends, and he is still here, waiteinge upon that occasion, wee not thinkeinge it necessary he should depart, till it be fully setled and adjusted"; the chief cause of writing now "is to acquaint you that this eveni[n]g my brother [Thomas] Lower and I were with Sir Tho[mas] Raulinson [Rawlinson] to offerr him paym[en]t of ye last years rent, carryinge money to discharge it, but he would not receive it, sayinge it would disorder his acco[un]ts to take so small a part of it here, and that he would have it paid to his receiver in ye country, exclaimeing ag[ain]st brother Abraham for putting him to so great trouble and calling his title in question, which has not been done by any but himself. Wee told him his refusall was, as he thought, upon a conscientous acco[un]t and would have him put a favorable construction upon it, but he would by no meanes be persuaded but it was a dishonest designe in him to defeat him of his right [to collect fee farm rent], exclaimeinge ye more because he sayd ther[e] was £111 paid to him to discharge this rent, which is not questioned by any but himselfe, saying broth[e]r Lower paid it, so we thinke it will be safe for you to see it paid to his receiver. I thinke he sayd his name was Simpson of Flookburrough [Flookborough]. However let it be paid, least ye necglect of it should add a furth[e]r charge. He told us he did expect his receiver would in a few dayes give him an acco[u]nt that all his rents to ye time called Michaelmas last were paid, tho[ugh] he knew not by what hands it would be done. I mention this passage, doubtinge least some adversaries should do it, thereby to make a gaine to ymselves [themselves] by preyinge furth[e]r upon ye estate, which cannot be prevented but by a timely paym[en]t of ye rent. Wee have laboured much to bring my broth[e]r to an understandinge and satisfaction in ye matter, being satisfied it could not be tithes [Daniel Abraham felt that fee farm rent charge was a form of tithes] because ther[e] is tithes payed besydes this incumbrance out of ye estate, and I thinke he was convinct [convinced] of his errour and mistake before he tooke out ye contents of what is recorded in ye Dutchy [of Lancaster] Office, which declares it to be a fee farme rent, and ther[e]fore may without any further doubt or scruple be paid hereafter. Wee were not willinge to omitt this post, supposeing if ye rent be paid before this next quarter day, it may put a stopp to the[i]r proceedings, who seem very sharp and designeinge to make advantages out of ye ruines of other men's estates, especially where they have ye pretence of lawes on the[i]r sides, or for the[i]r justification. It has happened very strang[e]ly that this damage and loss should be sustained without a due enquiry into ye nature of ye claime, but seeinge what's past cannot be recalled, wee hope for ye future it may be avoided, and that ye excercise occasioned ther[e]by may not afflict you any more, nor those concerned for you here. As to ye purchassinge of it off, it does not seem probable at present, but if any thinge can be done hereaft[e]r, ye oppertunity will be taken notice of by bro[ther] Lower, who has been very painefull and diligent in this buisiness hitherto"; love from he [William Ingram] and wife [Susannah nee Fell] "to our d[ea]r mother [Margaret Fox formerly Fell],...to thyself and son [John Abraham], and love also from brother [Daniel] Abraham

Research Notes: The first page contains a letter sent by William Ingram to Rachel Abraham. It appears that she responded to his letter on the second page/back side and Horle assumes she sent it back to Ingram. 

This letter does not have a date. The calendar notes that this letter was likely sent before letter 39. I chose to put the year in brackets to denote uncertainty and leave the day/month blank.

Contents: Received her letter "of ye 16th of ye last month [August, 1700]" and were, as usual, refreshed by it, "blesseinge ye Lord that thou art still continued to be a comfort to thy children, who, I beleive, have no outward greater joy then that to heare of thy health and welfare, as was signified in thy last"; he [William Ingram] and wife [Susannah nee Fell] "with relations here are continued in ye like condition of health", although it is "a sickly time with many"; Charles Bathust [Bathurst], "an ancient Fr[ien]d is lately dead [on the 4th of the 7th month i.e. September, 1700]"; have received a letter "yesterday from my sist[e]r [Isabel] Morrice [formerly Yeamans] at Lincoln, who after haveing signified her desire of knowing how it was with thee, advises of a state of mortality in the[i]r country, attended wth a sort of feavor, which occasions sudden death, and many dye of it. Ye like in some measure has attended people hereaway, but ye distemper not so extreame"; understand that sister [Margaret] Rouse [Rous nee Fell] "took her journey from Pontefract some time since to give thee a vissitt, and sist[e]r [Mary] Lower [nee Fell] more lately went from hence in order thereunto. Wee hope they are both safely arrived, though wee heard not of sist[e]r Lower, since her acco[un]t from Lancaster, and of her being ther[e] last 4th day was a weeke, except my broth[e]r [Thomas Lower] had anything by yesterday's post, whom since I have not seen. I desire they may knowe if no better information come to the[i]r hands, that I saw coussen Nath[aniel] Rouse [Rous] last night and he sayd both he, his wife [Hannah nee Woods] and son [John?] were well, and my brother Lower on ye 5th day acquaint[e]d me his family was in like condition"; also understand "by thy letter to broth[e]r [William] and sist[e]r [Sarah] Meade about coussen Nathanael [Nathaniel], the[i]r son, that thou wast in some excercise upon that account. I was somewhat concerned to desire thee not to let in any trouble into thy minde about that matter, for I hope all will come out well at last, for I knowe in part ye great care and diligence they have used to have him preserved in a sence of Truth, and out of ye polutions of this world, which I and many more that knowe him, are satisfied he is cleare and clean from, but so it has happened that he beinge of an active minde, could not content himself without some buissiness and diversion, more then ye country life with his fath[e]r [William Meade] and mother [Sarah Meade nee Fell] did afford, so the[i]r care and great concerne was how to fitt him with what might be most su[i]teable to his condition and inclination, which they were endeavoringe about for a considerable time, but nothinge yt was su[i]table presentinge, they gave him a diversion into Holland, of which thou hast been enformed"; when he returned, "ye matter of buisiness and employm[en]t againe entred into his consideration and he could not be satisfied with any arguments to diswade him from it, nor could be perswaded to accept of a country life with his father and mother" which is what they aimed at and desired; finally it was left to him to choose what employment to take "and he chose to understand ye Law, which I do not see is intended as though he should be a practitioner in it or make a pecuniarie advantage of it (for ther's no need of that), but to advance him in ye knowledg[e] of that so necessary to be knowne and to divert him for a season out of ye way of other company, who seemed to waite for acquaintance with him, which would not have done him good, tho[ugh] proffesinge Truth, nor been to his advantage any way, as it's hoped this may"; all things considered, "ther[e] does not seem much more could have been done on ye parents parts, who I knowe he is as dear to as the apple of the[i]r eye, and they are dayly attendinge him for his good, haveing placed him in an appartm[en]t next to a kinsman (and counsellor) who hath ye character of a very sober and honest man, and I am satisfied from what I knowe of him, he would rather be help to him, then a hindrance upon any acco[un]t"; must be left to the Lord; has written this in order "that thou mayst be satisfied in my broth[e]r and sister's care in this buisiness, and yt accordinge to my sense, they have not done anything on the[i]r parts, that may be occasion of trouble, either to thee (who I knowe are greatly concerned for coussen Nathanael), nor any other that have true respect for him"; love from he [William Ingram] and wife [Susannah nee Fell]

And tho I have had the misfortune to marry so, yet I have got a verry honest man who never debarrs me of going to ye meetings of Friends as oft as I please, so that I want for nothing but ye conversation of a husband of my principles, which yet I must own is a great loss.

Contents: "I am favored with your's and above I send you a good bill for £15 in exchange for your note. I have got the estate valued and measured. Clark's farm is 48 acres, 3 R[ods], 31 p[erches] valued at £117, 5[s], 6[d] p[er] ann[um], and Massey's farm is 7 acres, 0 r[ods], 24 p[erches] valued at £14, 11[s], 7[d] [the total acreage and value of the two are given as well], at which rents I bilieve there wo[uld?] be no difficulty in having good tenants and I presume the estates estimate your interest therein at £1,900 or thereabouts, when the present tenants terms are out, if Mr [Richard] Marriot will agree to what I have before recommended and which he can have no material or reasonable objection to, unless it be to depreciate your share of the estates, which I cannot suppose he could attempt or wish for. I sho[ul]d think the estate may s ell as well for your interest the next year as being longer postponed, and therefore the sooner you see Mr Marriot to put the business upon a proper footing and probably the better it may be"

Contents: "Yours of the 19th only reached me last evening, and in reply have to inform you I will have great pleasure in assisting your inquiries in every way in my power. I have many deeds in my possession relating to Swarthmoor Hall, most of them of old dates", but the oldest appears to be dated the 8th of July, 1691, which is "a large one and somewhat of a curiosity in it's way", and which is signed by the following- "Charles Fell, Mary Fell, Margaret Fox [formerly Fell], Hannah Fell [nee Cooke], James Graves, Isabella Graves [nee Fell], John Rous, Margaret [nee Fell, jr.] Rous, W[illia]m Morrice, Isabella [Isabel] Morrice [nee Fell], William Meade, Sarah Meade [nee Fell], Thomas Lower, Mary Lower [nee Fell], William Ingram, Susannah Ingram [nee Fell], Rachel Abraham [nee Fell], Thomas Cotton and Mary [Cotton?]. The deed is a conveyance from the parties to Daniel Abraham, who I expect married a daughter of Judge [Sir Thomas] Fell [the daughter was Rachel]. It recites that Charles Fell, Esq. of Swarthmoore [Swarthmoor], the grandfather of the said Charles Fell. The great Grandfather of Charles is described as George, having in possession Hawkswell, in the parish of Ulverston, but not stated to reside there, Margret Fox of Swarthmoore, widow, Grandmother of the said Charles and heretofore the wife of Thomas Fell, Hannah Fell [nee Cooke], widow, relict of the said George Fell and mother of the said Charles Fell, Isabella Graves, only daughter of the said George Fell, John Bows [corrected in another hand to 'Rous'], of Kingston upon Thames in county of Surry [Surrey], Merchant, Abraham Morrice of the county of Lincoln, Mercer, William Meade of Fann [corrected in another hand to 'Fen'] Church [Fenchurch] Street, city of London, Merchant, Thomas Lower of Marsh Grainge [Grange], co. of Lancaster, Gentleman, William Ingram, of the city of London aforasaid, Tallow Chandler, Daniel Abraham of Swarthmoore Hall, Gentl[e]m[an]. The above Gentlemen married Margaret, [junior], Isabella [Isabel], Sarah, Mary, Susannah and Rachel, the six surviving daughters of the said Thomas Fell. Thomas Cotton of Ulverstone [Ulverston], Yeoman was the surviving ex[ecu]t[o]r of the last will of Thomas Fell. In the year 1759, William Lindow, Esq. Merchant of Lancaster, became the purchaser. He left it to his sister Eleanor, the wife of Mr James Jackson, described as Merch[an]t and Hatter of Ulverston for life with an entailo upon her daughter Ann, the wife of Mr William Dickinson, surgeon, Workington, and her eldest son. My Mother died in 1823 when it became my property as such eldest son. All the deeds shew that the estate was formerly of considerable extent and comprised, amongst other premises, three Corn Mills, three Malt Kilns and several estates and manors in the neighbourhood of Ulverston. It's value may be in part known by the extent of mortgage which Sir William Wintworth [Wentworth?], Bart., of Button Hall, co. York[shire] had upon it, £6,000. The Deed is dated, 24 Dec[em]b[e]r 1743. To all the signatures to the Deed of July 1691 Seals are attached, which appear to belong to different families. It is probable from what I have stated above that the family of Judge Fell had property in the district before his day. I have never seen his will and cannot discover in the hasty search made wheather Swarthmoore Hall had an estate of inheritance or otherwise. It is in some of the Deeds spell[ed] 'Swartymoore' or 'Swarthmoor Hall' and in some their is the final 'e'. If you think I can give any further information, I will again search or show any of my papers to any friend you wish, or should you or any one for you wish to examine the old house, I will give directions to the farmer to show you through it. All the old mouldings and ornamental parts have always been reported to Judge Fell. Many well carved pieces of pannelling and other things have been stolen from the place since I first knew it,...upwards of 50 years. I have heard that Mr [Robert] Abraham, who now edits a newspaper in Liverpool (The Journal), and who I expect is a descendant of the family [he was the son of Thomas Abraham, of Seaton, and Orpah Clarke; see Joseph Foster, The Pedigree of the Forsters of Cold Hesledon (1862), p. 21] who once owned the estate, has several papers relating to it and the family. As he lived in Whitehaven some time, I can read[i]ly obtain his address should you wish it"

Contents: "I have had a short extract made from the Deed of 1691 [see number 62] which places beyond dispute that Judge [Sir Thomas] Fell's father was called George, and that the estate called Hawswell, otherwise Hawkswell had been in the family four generations. The deed is very long, covering 7 large skins of parchment and not being much accustomed to extract from such papers I find some difficulty in furnishing all you wish for. I expect it was Judge Fell that had the manors, but it is not stated how he became possessed of tnem. His property must have been large. The Deed recites the names and amount of rents of all the tenants-at-will and customary tenants of the Manor, or Lordship of Ulverstone [Ulverston], Blowith [Blawith], Nibthwait [Nibthwaite], etc. etc., and after, it sums up the property to be surrendered as situated in the parishes, townships, villages and places, of Ulverston, Swarthmoor, Dragleybeck, Hawkswell, Blowith, Lowith [Lowick], Pennington, Unwick [Urswick], Dalton, Coulton [Colton], Hawkshead, Nibthwait [Nibthwaite],a place name illegibled [a different hand has written above in pencil the place name 'Bethecar'?], Furness and Furness Fell [for more on these areas, see J.D. Marshall. Furness and the Industrial Revolution (1958)]. Some of the property is stated to consist of water, corn mills, windmills, iron furnaces, Forges, fisheries, customary rents, etc. etc. I again repeat, that I will with pleasure, give any other information in my power, as my papers only go back to 1691"; believes that Mr Abraham's family "will gave some of much older date"

Contents: "Mr. Perry called at my house some time ago when I was from home. I afterwards saw him in Cockermouth when he informed me of the purport of his visit and promised to call again the first time he was over. I have not since seen him. I will therefore do the best I can to answer some of your queries and hope when Mr Perry sees the papers he will be able to give all the information you require. The deed of 8th of July 1691 [see numbers 62 and 63] is one of sale to Mr Dan[ie]l Abraham, consideration £4,500, of which £3,900 was to be paid cash to J[ohn] Rouse [Rous], Ab[raha]m Morrice, William Meade, Thomas Lower, William Ingram...The Seal, I expect, the same as you sent. I have, however (being little versed in Heraldry) enclosed some rubbings of two Seals, one Rachill [Rachel] Abraham [nee Fell], the other Marg[are]t Fox's [formerly Fell], who it appears on the Deed has used the same. The other two are from the Fells. I have endeavoured also to take an impression in wax from both, which I send you. The estate I possess is tithe free, but it is only a small portion of what it formerly was. I have something more than 100 acres. As the estate was mortgaged to Sir W[illiam] Wentworth in 1743 it must have increased in value. The [blank] of latest date from your family I have are from John Abraham, the last, a copy of fine [for conveyances by fine, see A.W.B. Simpson, An Introduction to the History of the Land Law (1961), pp/ 115-117] from him and his wife [Sarah nee Foster] to Maude and Dodgson dated 31st Aug[us]t 1736. I have not had time to lookover the Deeds, therefore cannot say what was the extent in 1747. The estate came to me by entail. Mr [William] Lindow [see number 62] left it and other property to his sister Eleanor, the wife of Mr Ja[me]s Jackson (my Grandmother). My mother was an only child and from her it came to me as eldest son. I have given you a short abstract of the Deeds I possess and if you think I can furnish you with any other information I will be glad to give it"; [there follows a list of legal papers in the possession of W.L. Dickinson]- "1691, July 8th- Conveyance to Dan[ie]l Abraham; 1691, Oct[ober] 1st- [Charles] Fell and Tomlinsons to [William] Ingram in trust for Dan[ie]l Abraham; 1721q, Feb[ruary] 2nd- Deed for fine- Abraham to Forster; 1736, Jan[uary] 25th- Mr Abraham to Mr Forster, Mortgage £4,360; 1736, July 24th- Mr Abraham and Mr Forster to Maude and Dodgson; 1736, Aug[ust] 31st- Copy of fine, Abraham and wife to Maude and Dodgson; 1736, Nov[ember] - Mr Forster's will?
